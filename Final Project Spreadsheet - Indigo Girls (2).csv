Indigo Girls,loves recovery,during the time of which i speak it was hard to turn the other cheek to the blows of insecurity feeding the cancer of my intellect the blood of love soon neglected lay dying in the strength of its impurity meanwhile our friends we thought were so together theyve all gone and left each other in search of fairer weather and we sit here in our storm and drink a toast to the slim chance of loves recovery there i am in younger days star gazing painting picture perfect maps of how my life and love would be not counting the unmarked paths of misdirection my compass faith in loves perfection i missed ten million miles of road i should have seen meanwhile our friends we thought were so together left each other one by one in search of fairer weather and we sit here in our storm and drink a toast to the slim chance of loves recovery rain soaked and voice choked like silent screaming in a dream i search for our absolute distinction not content to bow and bent to the whims of culture that swoop like vultures eating us away eating us away eating us away to our extinction oh how i wish i were a trinity so if i lost a part of me id still have two of the same to live but nobody gets a lifetime rehearsal as specks of dust were universal to let this love survive would be the greatest gift we could give tell all the friends who think theyre so together that these are ghosts and mirages these thoughts of fairer weather though its storming out i feel safe within the arms of loves discovery

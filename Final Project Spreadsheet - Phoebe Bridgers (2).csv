Phoebe Bridgers,you missed my heart,broke into her house saw her sitting there drinking coke and whiskey in her bra and underwear saw him in the kitchen hanging up the phone i asked him nicely once to pack his things and go he gave her a reassuring look said he wouldnt leave but i asked him one more time this time pulled out my shiv struck him in the back and i pulled it out slow and i watched him fall down and as the morning sun rose he looked at me and said you missed my heart you missed my heart you got me good i knew you would but you missed my heart you missed my heart were his last words before he died looking out the window up at the blue sky listening to her scream listening to her cry a feeling of relief came over my soul i couldnt take it any longer and i lost control i chased her up the stairs and i pinned her to the ground and underneath her whimpering i could hear the sirens sound i rattled off a list of all the things i missed like going to the movies with her and the way she kissed me driving into downtown wheeling showing her off backyard barbecues and reunions in the park i said i missed her skin and when started laughing and while i clenched down on her wrist she said thats quite a list but theres one thing you missed you missed my heart you missed my heart thats quite a list but what you really missed you missed my heart you missed my heart thats quite a list but what you really missed running through the parking lot running through the fields policemen on my back something hit my skull and cracked they dragged me off to jail set a million dollar bail where i tried to tie a noose but i failed and i broke loose i went racing through the prison yard shot down by a tower guard he got me in the shins and he got me in the arms they strapped me in the gurney took me off to the infirmary where the priest read my last rites and just before everything went dark i said: he missed my heart he missed my heart he got me good i knew he would but he missed my heart he missed my heart and just before everything went dark the most poetic dream came flowing like the sea laying there my lifeblood draining out of me a childhood scene then sky moon beams fishing with my friends sitting in the wild reeds watching the ohio river flow at night waiting for the bullhead catfishes to bite downriver from the moundsville prison graveyard

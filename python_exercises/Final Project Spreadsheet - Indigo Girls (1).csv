Indigo Girls,Closer to Fine,"Im trying to tell you something about my life
Maybe give me insight between black and white
And the best thing youve ever done for me
Is to help me take my life less seriously
Its only life after all
Well darkness has a hunger thats insatiable
And lightness has a call thats hard to hear
And I wrap my fear around me like a blanket
I sailed my ship of safety til I sank it
Im crawling on your shores
And I went to the doctor I went to the mountains
I looked to the children I drank from the fountains
Theres more than one answer to these questions pointing me in a crooked line
And the less I seek my source for some definitive
Closer I am to fine
Closer I am to fine
And I went to see the doctor of philosophy
With a poster of Rasputin and a beard down to his knee
He never did marry or see a B grade movie
He graded my performance he said he could see through me
I spent four years prostrate to the higher mind
Got my paper and I was free
I went to the doctor I went to the mountains
I looked to the children I drank from the fountains
Theres more than one answer to these questions pointing me in crooked line
And the less I seek my source for some definitive
Closer I am to fine
Closer I am to fine
I stopped by the bar at 3 A M
To seek solace in a bottle or possibly a friend
And I woke up with a headache like my head against a board
Twice as cloudy as Id been the night before
And I went in seeking clarity
I went to the doctor I went to the mountains
I looked to the children I drank from the fountain
We go to the doctor we go to the mountains
We look to the children we drink from the fountain
We go to the Bible we go through the workout
We read up on revival we stand up for the lookout
Theres more than one answer to these questions pointing me in a crooked line
And the less I seek my source for some definitive
Closer I am to fine
Closer I am to fine
Closer I am to fine"
Indigo Girls,Secure Yourself,"In the ink of an eye I saw you bleed
Through the thunder I could hear you scream 
Solid to the air I breath 
Open eyed and fast asleep 
Falling softly as the rain
No footsteps ringing in your ears 
Ragged down worn to the skin 
Warrior raging have no fear 
Secure yourself to heaven 
Hold on tight the night has come 
Fasten up your earthly burdens 
You have just begun 
Kneeling down with broken prayers 
Hearts and bones from days of youth 
Restless with an angels wing 
I dig a grave to bury you 
No feet to fall 
You need no ground 
Allowed to glide right through the sun 
Released from circles guarded tight 
Now we all are chosen ones 
Secure yourself to heaven 
Hold on tight the night has come 
Fasten up your earthly burdens 
You have just begun"
Indigo Girls,Kid Fears,"Pain from pearls hey little girl 
How much have you grown 
Pain from pearls hey little girl 
Flower for the ones youve known 
Are you on fire 
From the years 
What would you give for your
Kid fears 
Secret staircase running high 
You had a hiding place 
Secret staircase running low 
But they all know now youre inside 
Are you on fire 
From the years 
What would you give for your
Kid fears 
Skipping stones we know the price now 
Any sin will do 
How much further if you can spin 
How much further if you are smooth 
Are you on fire 
From the years 
What would you give for your
Kid fears 
Replace the rent with the stars above 
Replace the need with love 
Replace the anger with the tide 
Replace the ones the ones the ones that you love 
Replace the rent with the stars above 
Replace the need with love 
Replace the anger with the tide 
Replace the ones the ones the ones that you love 
Are you on fire 
From the years 
What would you give for your
Kid fears 
Replace the rent with the stars above 
Replace the need with love 
Replace the anger with the tide 
Replace the ones the ones the ones that you love"
Indigo Girls,Prince Of Darkness,"My place is of the sun and this place is of the dark
I do not feel the romance I do not catch the spark
I dont know when I noticed life was life at my expense
The words of my heart lined up like prisoners on a fence
The dreams came in like needy children tugging at my sleeve
I said I have no way of feeding you so leave
But there was a time I asked my father for a dollar
And he gave it a ten dollar raise
When I needed my mother and I called her
She stayed with me for days
And now someones on the telephone desperate in his pain
Someones on the bathroom floor doing her cocaine
Someones got his finger on the button in some room
No one can convince me we arent gluttons for our doom
But I tried to make this place my place
I asked for Providence to smile upon me with his sweet face
But Ill tell you
My place is of the sun and this place is of the dark
I do not feel the romance I do not catch the spark
My place is of the sun and this place is of the dark
(By grace my sight grows stronger and I will not
be a pawn for the Prince of Darkness any longer)
Maybe theres no haven in this world for tender age
My heart beat like the wings of wild birds in a cage
My greatest hope my greatest cause to grieve
And my heart flew from its cage and it bled upon my sleeve
The cries of passion were like wounds that needed healing
I couldnt hear them for the thunder
I was half the naked distance between hell and heavens ceiling
And he almost pulled me under
Now someones on the telephone desperate in his pain
Someones on the bathroom floor doing her cocaine
Someones got his finger on the button in some room
No one can convince me we arent gluttons for our doom
I tried to make this place my place
I asked for Providence to smile upon me with his sweet face
But Ill tell you
My place is of the sun and this place is of the dark
I do not feel the romance I do not catch of spark
My place is of the sun and this place is of the dark
(By grace my sight grows stronger grows stronger)
I do not feel the romance I do not catch the spark
(And I will not be a pawn for the Prince of Darkness any longer)"
Indigo Girls,Blood and Fire,"
I have spent nights with matches and knives 
Leaning over ledges only two flights up 
Cutting my heart burning my soul 
Nothing left to hold 
Nothing left but blood and fire 

You have spent nights thinking of me 
Missing my arms but you needed to leave 
Leaving my cuts leaving my burns 
Hoping Id learn 

Blood and fire
Are too much for these restless arms to hold 
And my nights of desire are calling me 
Back to your fold 
And I am calling you calling you from 10 000 miles away
Wont you wet my fire with your love babe 

I am looking for someone who can take as much as I give 
Give back as much as I need 
And still have the will to live 
I am intense I am in need 
I am in pain I am in love 
I feel forsaken like the things I gave away 

Blood and fire
Are too much for these restless arms to hold 
And my nights of desire are calling me 
Back to your fold 
And I am calling you calling you from 10 000 miles away
Wont you wet my fire with your love babe 

I am intense I am in need I am in pain I am in love 
I am intense I am in need I am in pain I am in love 
I am intense I am in need I am in pain I am in love 

Blood and fire
Are too much for these restless arms to hold 
And my nights of desire are calling me 
Back to your fold 
And I am calling you calling you from 10 000 miles away
Wont you wet my fire with your love babe "
Indigo Girls,Tried to be True,"From baby to best with no second test 
Little storms destroy you 

Here is the fame they promised to give you 
Taking the place of my hand now 

Did you try to be true 
What separates me from you 
What separates me from you now 

Did you borrow the soul 
The soul that you sell now 
What does your conscience tell you 
Where are the demons
Of your desire 
Why does my love destroy you 

Did you try to be true 
What separates me from you 
What separates me from you now 

I said I tried to be true 
What separates me from you 
I said I tried tried to be true 
What separates me from you 
What separates me from you now 

Did you try to be true 
What separates me from you 
What separates me from you now 

So where is the fame 
Where is the fortune 
Where is the world that denies you 
Who is to blame 
When my heart finally forfeits
To a road that will only misguide you 

Did you try to be true 
What separates me from you 
What separates me from you now 

Did we try to be true 
What separates me from you 
Did we try try to be true 
What separates me from you:

Did you try to be true 
What separates me from you 
What separates me from you now 

I bought my love a hunger
More precious than a stone 
All these fatal flowers 
Did I misguide you 
(Where is the world that denies you)
(Try to be true)

Did you try to be true 
What separates me from you 
What separates me from you now "
Indigo Girls,Loves Recovery,"During the time of which I speak it was hard to turn the other cheek
To the blows of insecurity
Feeding the cancer of my intellect the blood of love soon neglected
Lay dying in the strength of its impurity
Meanwhile our friends we thought were so together
Theyve all gone and left each other in search of fairer weather
And we sit here in our storm and drink a toast
To the slim chance of loves recovery 
There I am in younger days star gazing 
Painting picture perfect maps of how my life and love would be
Not counting the unmarked paths of misdirection
My compass faith in loves perfection
I missed ten million miles of road I should have seen
Meanwhile our friends we thought were so together
Left each other one by one in search of fairer weather
And we sit here in our storm and drink a toast
To the slim chance of loves recovery 
Rain soaked and voice choked like silent screaming in a dream
I search for our absolute distinction
Not content to bow and bent
To the whims of culture that swoop like vultures
Eating us away eating us away
Eating us away to our extinction
Oh how I wish I were a trinity so if I lost a part of me
Id still have two of the same to live
But nobody gets a lifetime rehearsal as specks of dust were universal
To let this love survive would be the greatest gift we could give
Tell all the friends who think theyre so together
That these are ghosts and mirages these thoughts of fairer weather
Though its storming out I feel safe within the arms of loves discovery"
Indigo Girls,Lan of Canaan,"You can go to the East
To find your inner hemisphere 
You say were under the same sky babe 
Youre bound to realize Honey its not that clear 
Im not your promise land
Im not your promise one
Im not your Land of Canaan sweetheart 
Waiting for you under the sun 
Im lonely tonight Im missing you now 
Im wanting your love and youre giving it out 
Im lonely tonight Im lonely tonight Im lonely tonight 
Well the meanings changed (for what its worth) 
Its just a senseless game 
I should think of love but its fear every time I hear
Your heart strain 
Its not the fallen man 
Its not the call of time 
Its just the London skyline
Telling me youre not mine
Im lonely tonight Im missing you now 
Im wanting your love and youre giving it out 
Im lonely tonight Im lonely tonight Im lonely tonight 
My blood is running dry
My skin is my skin is growing thin
For every time you find yourself
You lose a little bit of me from within 
Its just a raging cycle why cant we
Bring it all to the end of the line 
From inside this existence sweetheart 
Time is not on my side 
Im lonely tonight Im missing you now 
Im wanting your love and youre giving it out 
Im lonely tonight Im lonely tonight Im lonely tonight 
Im not your promised land Im not your promised one 
Im not your promised land Im not your promised one 
Im not your Land of Canaan Sweetheart 
Im not your Land of Canaan Sweetheart 
Im not your Land of Canaan Sweetheart 
Waiting for you under the sun Im lonely tonight "
Indigo Girls,Center Stage,"Laughing in a crown of jewels 
Numbness from a scepters wound 
Toss and Turn I spin and learn 
Catch yourself before you burn 
A jokers dance before the king 
Jangling beads a silver ring 
Close your eyes and bare the sound 
Jumping up falling down 
Falling Falling Falling Falling down 
Look yourself in the eye before you drown 
Royal rebels discover you 
Trust  you turn there is no truth 
And circle circle why are you scared 
Why a smile instead of tears 
Im gulping smoke to fade away 
Figures floating down to lay 
Meet the joker and the thief 
The king and queen but no relief 
Falling Falling Falling Falling down 
Look yourself in the eye before you drown 
The king is in the counting house counting out his money
{Look yourself in the eye before you drown  Falling Falling Falling Falling down }
Falling Falling Falling Falling down 
Look yourself in the eye before you drown 
The queen is in her parlour eating bread and honey
{Look yourself in the eye before you drown  Falling Falling Falling Falling down }
Falling Falling Falling Falling down 
Look yourself in the eye before you drown 
Mary had a little lamb
I cross myself before I die
The leaping man he asks me why 
Well your rhythm is off I reply 
Now you must dance the dance
That you imply!
Your actions will follow you full circle round 
Your actions will follow you full circle round 
Your actions will follow you full circle round 
Your actions will follow you full circle round 
The higher the leap I said 
The harder the ground!

Indigo Girls,History of Us,"I went all the way to Paris to forget your face
Captured in stained glass young lives long since passed
Statues of lovers every place
I went all across the continent to relieve this restless love
I walked through the ruins icons of glory
Smashed by the bombs from above
So we must love while these moments are still called today
Take part in the pain of this passion play
Stretching our youth as we must until we are ashes to dust
Until time makes history of us
Jeu de Paumes full of faces knowing peace knowing strife
Leisure and toil still its canvas and oil
Theres just no medium for life
In the midst of the rubble I felt a sense of rebirth
In a dusty cathedral the living God called
And I prayed for my life here on earth
So we must love while these moments are still called today
Take part in the pain of this passion play
Stretching our youth as we must until we are ashes to dust
Until time makes history of us
There are mountains in Switzerland brilliant cold as they stand
From my hotel room watching the half moon
Bleeding its light like a lamb
And the town is illumined its tiny figures are fast asleep
And it dawns on me the time is upon me
To return to the flock I must keep
So we must love while these moments are still called today
Take part in the pain of this passion play
Stretching our youth as we must until we are ashes to dust
Until time makes history of us"
Indigo Girls,Three Hits,"Three hits to the heart son
And its poetry in motion
One could send you down the river
Threes a strange way to be delivered
Would you trade your words for freedom 
Thats a barter for a blind man
Three hits to the heart son
And its poetry in motion
Are you leveed like a treasure 
Only words can help me find you
And this worlds a fickle measure
I will painfully remind you
From a wise man to your red hand
You lay covered in our best sins
Three hits to the heart son
And its poetry in motion
Well I dream you constant stranger
With your best bloods and your anger
You say Mother do you claim me 
My beloved do you blame me 
Well the first two might release you
But the last one sings in me son
Three hits to the heart son
And its poetry in motion
Three hits to the heart son
And the last one sings in me"
Indigo Girls,Galileo,"Galileos head was on the block
The crime was looking up the truth
And as the bombshells of my daily fears explode
I try to trace them to my youth
And then you had to bring up reincarnation
Over a couple of beers the other night   
An now Im serving time for mistakes
Made by another in another lifetime
How long til my soul gets it right 
Can any human being ever reach that kind of light 
I call on the resting soul of Galileo:
King of night vision king of insight
An then I think about my fear of motion
Which I never could explain
Some other fool across the ocean years ago
Must have crashed his little airplane
How long til my soul gets it right 
Can any human being ever reach that kind of light 
I call on the resting soul of Galileo:
King of night vision king of insight
Im not making a joke
You know me I take everything so seriously
If we wait for the time til all souls get it right
Then at least I know therell be no nuclear annihilation
In my lifetime
Im still not right   
I offer thanks to those before me
Thats all Ive got to say
Cause maybe you squandered big bucks in your lifetime   
Now I have to pay!
But then again it feels like some sort of inspiration
To let the next life off the hook
Or shell say: look what I had to overcome from my last life   
I think Ill write a book!
How long till my soul gets it right 
(My soul gets it right)
Can any human being ever reach the highest light
Except for the resting soul of Galileo:
(Galileo    God bless your soul)
King of night vision king of insight 
How long 
(til my soul gets it right)
How long 
(til my soul gets it right)
How long 
(til my soul gets it right)"

Indigo Girls,Romeo and Juliet,"Love struck Romeo
Sings the streets a serenade
Hes layin everybody low
Hes got a love song that he made
Well he finds a convenient street light
And he steps out of the shade and says something like
You and me babe how about it 
Juliet says Hey its Romeo
You nearly gave me a heart attack yeah well
Hes underneath my window now shes singin
Hey la my boyfriends back
You shouldnt come around here
Singin up to people like that
Oh anyway what you gonna do about it 
Oh Juliet the dice were loaded from the start
And I bet
And you exploded into my heart
And I forget I forget the movie song
When you gonna realize 
It was just that the time was wrong
Julie
We both come up on different streets
And they were both streets of shame
Theyre both dirty both mean
And yes even our dreams were the same
But I dreamed your dream for you
And now your dream is real so tell me honey
Now how can you look at me as
If I were just another one of your deals 
Now you can fall for chains of silver
And you can fall for chains of gold
You know you you fall for pretty strangers
And the promises since they hold
Well you promised me everything
And then you and then you promised me thick and thin
And now you just turn away and say
Romeo I think I used to have a scene with him
Oh Juliet when we made love you used to cry
You said I love you like the stars above
Im gonna love you till I die
Theres a place for us I know you know this song
Now when you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong 
Julie Im so in love
So in love yeah
But I cant do the talk
Like they talk on my TV screen
I cant do a love song
Not the way you sung it to me
I cant do anything
But I would do anything for you oh no
I cant do anything
Except be in love with you
Yeah now all I do is miss you
And the way it used to be
And all and all I do is keep the beat
I keep bad bad company
And all I do is kiss you
Through the bars of this rhyme
When Julie Id do the stars with you
Anytime
Oh Juliet when we made love you used to cry
You said I love you like the stars above
Im gonna love you till I die
Theres a place for us I know you know the movie song
One day you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong

Sings the streets a serenade
Layin everybody low
Hes got a love song that he made
Finds a convenient street light

Phoebe Bridgers,Smoke Signals,"I went with you up to
The place you grew up in
We spent a week in the cold
Just long enough to
Walden it with you
Any longer it would have got old
Singing Ace of Spades when Lemmy died
But nothings changed L A s all right
Sleeping in my bed again and getting in my head
And then walk around the reservoir
You you must have been looking for me
Sending smoke signals
Pelicans circling
Burning trash out on the beach
One of your eyes is
Always half-shut
Something happened when you were a kid
I didnt know you then
And Ill never understand
Why it feels like I did
How Soon Is Now in an 80s sedan
You slept inside of it because your dad
Lived in a campground in the back of a van
You said that song will creep you out until youre deadAnd you must have been looking for me
Sending smoke signals
Pelicans circling
Burning trash out on the beach
I want to live at
The Holiday Inn
Where somebody else makes the bed
Well watch TV while
The lights on the street
Put all the stars to death
Its been on my mind since Bowie died
Just checking out to hide from life
And all of our problems Im gonna solve em
With you riding shot-gun speeding cause fuck the cops
And you you must have been looking for me
Sending smoke signals
Pelicans circling
Burning trash out on the beach
I buried a hatchet
Its coming up lavender
The futures unwritten
The past is a corridor
Im at the exit looking back through the hall
You are anonymous
I am a concrete wall"
Phoebe Bridgers,Motion Sickness,"I hate you for what you did
And I miss you like a little kid
I faked it every time but thats alright
I can hardly feel anything
I hardly feel anything at all
You gave me fifteen hundred
To see your hypnotherapist
I only went one time you let it slide
Fell on hard times a year ago
Was hoping you would let it go and you did
I have emotional motion sickness
Somebody roll the windows down
There are no words in the English language
I could scream to drown you out
Im on the outside looking through
Youre throwing rocks around your room
And while youre bleeding on your back in the glass
Ill be glad that I made it out
And sorry that it all went down like it did
I have emotional motion sickness
Somebody roll the windows down
There are no words in the English language
I could scream to drown you out
And why do you sing with an English accent
I guess its too late to change it now
You know Im never gonna let you have it
But I will try to drown you out
You said when you met me you were bored
You said when you met me you were bored
And you you were in a band when I was born
I have emotional motion sickness
I try to stay clean and live without
And I want to know what would happen
If I surrender to the sound
Surrender to the sound"
Phoebe Bridgers,Funeral,"Im singing at a funeral tomorrow
For a kid a year older than me
And Ive been talking to his dad it makes me so sad
When I think too much about it I cant breathe
And I have this dream where Im screaming underwater
While my friends are all waving from the shore
And I dont need you to tell me what that means
I dont believe in that stuff anymore
Jesus Christ Im so blue all the time
And thats just how I feel
Always have and I always will
I always have and always will
I have a friend I call
When Ive bored myself to tears
And we talk until we think we might just kill ourselves
But then we laugh until it disappears
And last night I blacked out in my car
And I woke up in my childhood bed
Wishing I was someone else feeling sorry for myself
When I remembered someones kid is dead
Jesus Christ Im so blue all the time
And thats just how I feel
Always have and I always will
I always have and always will
And its 4 AM again
And Im doing nothing
Again"
Phoebe Bridgers,Demi Moore,"Take a dirty picture babe
I cant sleep and I miss your face
In my hands and in my knees
Tell me what you wanna do to me
Tell me what youll do please
I dont wanna be alone
I dont wanna be alone anymore
You got quiet on the other line
Said the sun was coming up
And I laughed until I couldnt breathe
Now Im too tired to go to sleep
Now I cant breathe and I cant sleep
I dont wanna be stoned
I dont wanna be stoned anymore
Dont wanna be alone
Dont wanna be alone anymore
I could feel alone
I could I got a good feeling
It doesnt happen very often"
Phoebe Bridgers,Scott Street,"Walking Scott Street feeling like a stranger
With an open heart open container
Ive got a stack of mail and a tall can
Its a shower beer its a payment plan
Theres helicopters over my head
Every night when I go to bed
Spending money and I earned it
When Im lonely thats when Ill burn it
Do you feel ashamed
When you hear my name
I asked you How is your sister 
I heard she got her degree
And I said That makes me feel old
He said What does that make me 
I asked you How is playing drums 
You said its too much shit to carry
And what about the band 
You said theyre all getting married
Do you feel ashamed
When you hear my name
Anyway dont be a stranger
Anyway dont be a stranger
Dont be a stranger"
Phoebe Bridgers,Killer,"Sometimes I think Im a killer
Scared you in your house
Even scared myself by talking
About Dahmer on your couch
But I cant sleep next to a body
Even harmless in death
Plus Im pretty sure Id miss you
And faking sleep to count your breath
Can the killer in me
Tame the fire in you 
Is there nothing left to do for us 
I am sick of the chase
But Im hungry for blood
And theres nothing I can do
But when Im sick and tired
When my mind is barely there
When a machine keeps me alive
And Im losing all my hair
I hope you kiss my rotten head
And pull the plug
Know that Ive burned every playlist
And given all my love
Can the killer in me
Tame the fire in you 
I know theres something waiting for us
I am sick of the chase
But Im stupid in love
And theres nothing I can do
And theres nothing I can do"
Phoebe Bridgers,Georgia,"Georgia Georgia I love your son
When he gets older he might be the one
He might be the one
Georgia Georgia he has beautiful bones
And he never lies or picks up his phone
Sometimes in the pouring rain
Hell fall in the mud and get back up again
And if you find me
Will you know me
Will you take me
Or will you fall
Here is my day plan my new machine
He is a fine new addition so young and so clean
So young and so clean
He came up through the water without a sound
With my back to the shoreline I dreamt that he drowned
I dreamt that he drowned
Sometimes when he looks at me
I know that he needs you youre all that he sees
And if I had breathed you
Will it kill me
Will you have me
Or watch me fall
If I had fixed you
Will you hate me
Would you fuck this
And let us fall"
Phoebe Bridgers,Chelsea,"For a chemical imbalance you sure know how to ride a train
Your revolution is a deathbed and the music is your maid
When someone comes a knocking with a needle on a tray
Only your lonesome lies beside you
For you told me not to stay
You are somebodys baby some mother held you near
No its not important theyre just pretty words my dear
There is no distraction that can make me disappear
No theres nothing that wont remind you
I will always be right here
And you spit the blood back spit the blood back
Baby Im amazed that youre alright
Oh so long prison boy I wont be home with you tonight
Were both very sick our muscles all worn down
Its as if we are one-hundredâ€”no I wont still be around
Because Ive fallen yes Ive fallen right into the love I found
Long before I reach one-hundred
Ill have fallen to the ground
And for generations
Their romances make us more
Its much less than than ever was before the Chelsea and the floor
Make us stand before the masses like two speakers for the poor
When there was no revolution
Nothing we were fighting for
And you spit the blood back spit the blood back
Baby Im amazed that youre alright
Oh so long prison boy I wont be home
I wont be home
I wont be home with you tonight
And you can call the service bell
When we stay at the Chelsea hotel
And Ill stay out of my own head
Oh so long prison boy I wont be home
I wont be home
I wont be home with you tonight"
Phoebe Bridgers,Would You Rather,"Playing would you rather
When it comes to fire
You always say that youd prefer to drown
You were still in the ambulance
When the cop suggested
Youre the one who tried to burn it down
Come to find out
Im a can on a string youre on the end
We find our way out
Of a suicide pact of our family and friends
In the background Ill be waiting
We have the same face
I laid awake
As someone shoved you up against a wall
Quarantined in a bad dream
Hes half the man
And youre twice as tall
Come to find out
Im a can on a string youre on the end
We find our way out
Of a suicide pact of our family and friends
In the background Ill be waiting
Next time I see you youll show me
A hundred different ways to say the same things
Come to find out
Im a can on a string youre on the end
We find our way out
Of a suicide pact of our family and friends
And when you touch down Ill be waving"
Phoebe Bridgers,You Missed My Heart,"Broke into her house saw her sitting there
Drinking coke and whiskey in her bra and underwear
Saw him in the kitchen hanging up the phone
I asked him nicely once to pack his things and go
He gave her a reassuring look said he wouldnt leave
But I asked him one more time this time pulled out my shiv
Struck him in the back and I pulled it out slow
And I watched him fall down and as the morning sun rose
He looked at me and said
You missed my heart you missed my heart
You got me good I knew you would
But you missed my heart you missed my heart
Were his last words before he died
Looking out the window up at the blue sky
Listening to her scream listening to her cry
A feeling of relief came over my soul
I couldnt take it any longer and I lost control
I chased her up the stairs and I pinned her to the ground
And underneath her whimpering I could hear the sirens sound
I rattled off a list of all the things I missed
Like going to the movies with her and the way she kissed me
Driving into downtown Wheeling showing her off
Backyard barbecues and reunions in the park
I said I missed her skin and when started laughing
And while I clenched down on her wrist she said thats quite a list
But theres one thing you missed
You missed my heart you missed my heart
Thats quite a list but what you really missed
You missed my heart you missed my heart
Thats quite a list but what you really missed
Running through the parking lot running through the fields
Policemen on my back something hit my skull and cracked
They dragged me off to jail set a million dollar bail
Where I tried to tie a noose but I failed and I broke loose
I went racing through the prison yard shot down by a tower guard
He got me in the shins and he got me in the arms
They strapped me in the gurney took me off to the infirmary
Where the priest read my last rites
And just before everything went dark
I said: He missed my heart he missed my heart
He got me good I knew he would
But he missed my heart he missed my heart
And just before everything went dark
The most poetic dream came flowing like the sea
Laying there my lifeblood draining out of me
A childhood scene then sky moon beams
Fishing with my friends sitting in the wild reeds
Watching the Ohio river flow at night
Waiting for the bullhead catfishes to bite
Downriver from the Moundsville prison graveyard"
Phoebe Bridgers,Garden Song,"Someday Im gonna live
In your house up on the hill
And when your skinhead neighbor goes missing
Ill plant a garden in the yard then
Theyre gluing roses on a flatbed
You should see it I mean thousands
I grew up here till it all went up in flames
Except the notches in the doorframe
I dont know when you got taller
See our reflection in the water
Off a bridge at the Huntington
I hopped the fence when I was seventeen
Then I knew what I wanted
And when I grow up Im gonna look up
From my phone and see my life
And its gonna be just like my recurring dream
Im at the movies
I dont remember what Im seeing
The screen turns into a tidal wave
Then its a dorm room like a hedge maze
And when I find you
You touch my leg and I insist
But I wake up before we do it
I dont know how but Im taller
It must be something in the water
Everythings growing in our garden
You dont have to know that its haunted
The doctor put her hands over my liver
She told me my resentments getting smaller
No Im not afraid of hard work
I get everything I want
I have everything I wanted"
Phoebe Bridgers,Kyoto,"Day off in Kyoto got bored at the temple
Looked around at the 7-11
The band took the speed train went to the arcade
I wanted to go but I didnt
You called me from a payphone they still got pay phones
It costs a dollar a minute
To tell me youre getting sober and you wrote me a letter
But I dont have to read it
Im gonna kill you
If you dont beat me to it
Dreaming through Tokyo skies
I wanted to see the world
Then I flew over the ocean
And I changed my mind
Sunsets been a freak show
On the weekend so Ive been driving out to the suburbs
To park at the Goodwill and stare at the chem trails
With my little brother
He said you called on his birthday
You were off by like ten days
But you get a few points for trying
Remember getting the truck fixed when you let us drive it
25 felt like flying
I dont forgive you
But please dont hold me to it
Born under Scorpio skies
I wanted to see the world
Through your eyes until it happened
Then I changed my mind
Guess I lied
Im a liar
Who lies
Cause Im a liar"
Phoebe Bridgers,Punisher,"When the speed kicks in
I go to the store for nothing
And walk right by
The house where you lived with Snow White
I wonder if she ever thought
The storybook tiles on the roof were too much
But from the window its not a bad show
If your favorite things Dianetics or stucco
The drugstores are open all night
The only real reason I moved to the east side
I love a good place to hide in plain sight
What if I told you
I feel like I know you 
But we never met
And here everyone knows youre the way to my heart
Hear so many stories of you at the bar
Most times alone and some looking your worst
But never not sweet to the trust funds and punishers
Man I wish that I could say the same
I swear Im not angry thats just my face
A copycat killer with a chemical cut
Either Im careless or I wanna get caught
Who Im not
What if I told you
I feel like I know you 
But we never met
Its for the best
I cant open my mouth and forget how to talk
Cause even if I could
Wouldnt know where to start
Wouldnt know when to stop\\"
Phoebe Bridgers,Halloween,"I hate living by the hospital
The sirens go all night
I used to joke that if they woke you up
Somebody better be dying
Sick of the questions I keep asking you
They make you live in the past
But I can count on you to tell me the truth
When youve been drinking and youre wearing a mask
Baby its Halloween
We can be anything
Come on man
We can be anything
Always surprised what Id do for love
Some things Id never expect
They killed a fan down by the stadium
Was only visiting they beat him to death
Baby its Halloween
We can be anything
Come on man
We can be anything
Baby its Halloween
Theres a last time for everything
Come on man
We can be anything
Whatever you want
Ill be whatever you want
Whatever you want
Be whatever you want
Ill be whatever you want
(Whatever you want)
Ill be whatever you want
(Whatever you want)
(Whatever you want)"
Phoebe Bridgers,Chinese Satellite,"Ive been running around in circles
Pretending to be myself
Why would somebody do this on purpose
When they could do something else 
Drowning out the morning birds
With the same three songs over and over
I wish I wrote it but I didnt so I learn the words
Hum along til the feelings gone forever
Took a tour to see the stars
But they werent out tonight
So I wished hard on a Chinese satellite
I want to believe
Instead I look at the sky and I feel nothing
You know I hate to be alone
I want to be wrong
You were screamin at the Evangelicals
They were screamin right back from what I remember
When you said I will never be your vegetable
Because I think when youre gone its forever
But you know Id stand on the corner
Embarrassed with a picket sign
If it meant I would see you
When I die
Sometimes when I cant sleep
Its just a matter of time before Im hearing things
Swore I could feel you through the walls
But thats impossible
I want to believe
That if I go outside Ill see a tractor beam
Coming to take me to where Im from
I want to go home"
Phoebe Bridgers,Moon Song,"You asked to walk me home
But I had to carry you
And you pushed me in
Now my feet cant touch the bottom of you
You couldnt have you couldnt have
Stuck your tongue down the throat of somebody
Who loves you more
I will wait for the next time you want me
Like a dog with a bird at your door
We hate Tears in Heaven
But its sad his baby died
We fought about John Lennon
Until I cried
Then I went to bed upset
Now Im dreaming
And youre singing at my birthday
Ive never seen you smiling so big
Its nautical themed
And theres something Im supposed to say
Cant for the life of me remember what it is
And if I could give you the moon
I would give you the moon
You are sick and youre married
And you might be dying
But youre holding me like water in your hands
When you saw the dead little bird you started crying
But you know the killer doesnt understand"
Phoebe Bridgers,Savior Complex,"Emotional affair
Overly sincere
Smoking in the car windows up
Crocodile tears run the tap til its clear
Drift off on the floor
I drag you to the shore
Sweating through the sheets
Youre gonna drown in your sleep for sure
Wake up and start a big fire
In our one room apartment
But Im too tired
To have a pissing contest
All the bad dreams that you hide
Show me yours Ill show you mine
Call me when you land
Ill drive around again
One hand on the wheel one in your mouth
Turn me on and turn me down
Baby youre a vampire
You want blood and I promised
Im a bad liar
With a savior complex
All the skeletons you hide
Show me yours and Ill show you mine
All the bad dreams that you hide
Show me yours"
Phoebe Bridgers,ICU,"Laying down on the lawn
Im tired of trying to get in the house
Im thinking out loud
Ive been playing dead
My whole life
And I get this feeling whenever I feel good
Itll be the last time
But I feel something when I see you now
I feel something when I see you
If youre a work of art
Im standing too close
I can see the brush strokes
I hate your mom
I hate it when she opens her mouth
Its amazing to me how much you can say
When you dont know what youre talking about
But I feel something when I see you now
I feel something when I see you
I used to light you up
Now I cant even get you to play the drums
Cause I dont know what I want
Until I fuck it up
But I feel something when I see you now
I feel something
Ill climb through the window again
But right now it feels good not to stand
Then Ill leave it wide open
Let the dystopian morning light pour in"
Phoebe Bridgers,Graceland Too,"No longer a danger to herself or others
She made up her mind and laced up her shoes
Yelled down the hall but nobody answered
So she walked outside without an excuse
She could do anything she wants to
She could do whatever she wants to do
She could go home but shes not going to
So she picks a direction its ninety in Memphis
Turns up the music so thoughts dont intrude
Predictably winds up thinking of Elvis
And wonders if he believed songs could come true
Im asking for it if they do
Doesnt know what she wants
Or what shes gonna do
A rebel without a clue
So we spent what was left of our serotonin
To chew on our cheeks and stare at the moon
Said she knows shell live through it to get to this moment
Ate a sleeve of saltines on my floor and I knew that
I would do anything you want me to
I would do anything for you
I would do anything
I would do anything
Whatever you want me to do I will do
Whatever she wants
Whatever she wants
Whatever she wants (Whatever you want)
Whatever she wants (Whatever you want)
I would do anything (Whatever you want)
I would do anything (Whatever you want)
Whatever she wants (Whatever you want)
Whatever she wants (Whatever you want)"
Phoebe Bridgers,I Know The End,"Somewhere in Germany but I cant place it
Man I hate this part of Texas
Close my eyes fantasize
Three clicks and Im home
When I get back Ill lay around
Then Ill get up and lay back down
Romanticize a quiet life
Theres no place like my room
But you had to go I know I know I know
Like a wave that crashed and melted on the shore
Not even the burnouts are out here anymore
And you had to go I know I know I know
Out in the park we watch the sunset
Talkin on a rusty swing set
After a while you went quiet
And I got mean
Im always pushin you away from me
But you come back with gravity
And when I call you come home
A bird in your teeth
So I gotta go I know I know I know
When the sirens sound youll hide under the floor
But Im not gonna go down with my hometown in a tornado
Im gonna chase it I know I know I know
I gotta go now I know I know I know
Drivin out into the sun
Let the ultraviolet cover me up
Went looking for a creation myth
Ended up with a pair of cracked lips
Windows down scream along
To some America First rap-country song
A slaughterhouse an outlet mall
Slot machines fear of God
Windows down heater on
Big bolt of lightning hanging low
Over the coast everyones convinced
Its a government drone or an alien spaceship
Either way were not alone
Ill find a new place to be from
A haunted house with a picket fence
To float around and ghost my friends
No Im not afraid to disappear
The billboard said The End Is Near
I turned around there was nothing there
Yeah I guess the end is here
The end is here
The end is here
The end is here
The end is"

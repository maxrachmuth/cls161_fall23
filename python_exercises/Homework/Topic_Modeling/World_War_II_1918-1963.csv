'It the-e time. wo must do every

what may favorable or ndverse decision by President Wilson
the ""work or fight"" order as It concerns professional baseball
players, u more Intense International situation or Internal financial
s.orm the major leagues are certain to finish their pennant rnces, Speaking
for the National League the other day. John Heydlcr said that It w.n the
nrm uoterrnlnntloii of tho club owners to ""carry on'-' even ! thpy had to
recruit semi-professional and nmuteur players to fill out their force!. In
tho event of professional ball players In the draft belns forced to ro Into
other employment by July 1 more thun two-thirds of the major league
)ronneI would he lost and youngsters from tho sand lots would have to
bo taken 'on to fill their place?. These boys would not be likely to provide
a major league type of baseball, but bn owners eount on the Indulcenco
of the fan in such an emergency to overlook shortcomings so long as the
pime can be perpetuutcd and the continuity of competition maintained.
However, let it bo said that neither the owner nor the fan fears nny
such contingency. The President Is not likely to force tho ball player Into
other employment until nftcr the season is over. We expect that the world's
aeries, too, will be played. As for next year, the outlook for baesball H
not so hopeful. If the Hun still is at large we fear for the national game.
Should President Wilson glvo the leagues a respite it will be for this year
only. If the draft laws ,-ro changed to Include men from 19 to 43 it will
bo practically impossible to conduct a league with any kind of material.
II tit confidence rules supi -me there is light uhcad.
Benny Kauff He (Joes With Kterjbody's Best Wishes.
P.enny Kauff has gone to camn
most potent and popular players. Knuff's experienco in the National League
reminds us of Uoldsmlth's churchgoers who came to scoff and remained to
pray. If ever a man came Into the majors under difficult conditions it
was Kauff. Those who saw in the III fated Federal League only a subject
for general derision greeted"" Ku tiff's acquisition by tho Giants as something
ot a Joke. At best they regarded It as a doubtful experiment.
Kauff had been the batting hero of the Federals and when, ns a Glint,
he came to bat nnd-feUed to oblige the second guesters and howlers treated
him ns a pariah. Kauff did not mind all that. He Just kept quiet, listened
to advice, tried his hardest every minute of a game, and made good. He
goes from the National League with a record of which he may be very
proud with a batting average of .335, a reputation as n long distance
thrower second to nono and a fielder on a par with the best. When he
came here Kauff was a bit weak on ground balls, but under McUruw's
tutelage ho overcame that handicap.
Kauff has, from timo to time, been written about as a boastful, over
confident and unabashed Individual. In reality he is no more .boastful
than George Burns, no more ovcr-confldent than Ross Young, not ono whit
less modest than Walter Holke. Benny Is a ""regular feller."" and he goes
with the best wishes of everybody.
All Other Clubs Should Follow This Lead of the Giants.
,U last tho New York National League has seen tho light and has
j Issued an order admitting men In the
That goes our oft repeated demand one better, for we thought that the club,
for strong financial reasons nnd In order to prevent possible confusion,
might want to keep Saturdays and holldiys from the free list. Now that
the New York club has taken the Initiative it behooves the fifteen others
in the major leagues to follow suit. They cannot dodge the example.
The free gate for the service nt Giants' games comes partly because
Harry Hempstead had become convinced that the service merited at least
that consideration nnd partly through the cfTorts of the War Department's
Commission on Training Camp Activities. When nil the clubs have lifted
Hio'burH for the service It will rest with the commlsson to do a little mis
sionary work with the Government. There Is no reason In the world why
tho man in the service should be saddled with a war tax for the little recrea
tion that ho can get. In Canada there Is no such thing as a war tax for
the man in uniform. There should be none here. Let the commission get
hi'sy with anj amendment to the law.
Tesrean 'eer Would Have Been Wtlved Ont.
His confidence .""battered by his failure to regain his old form, .leff
Tesreau hns gone from the Giants to the Bethlehem club of the Steel
League. One of the tiub officials said that Tesreau's action was an admis
sion that as a major leaguer he was through. It was intimated that
McGrnw had been considering asking for waivers on the big right hander.
.toff's going is no excuse for casting aspersions. There isn't another club
In the majors which would not seize nt tho chance to get him.
.left might have continued on to success even with the Giants, nnd
n cbance of scene might have made n star of him once more. Witness the
icase of Itube Marquard. who was done with the Giants and was headed

The nearest thing to a crucial wrles
that the Yankees have put on In years
and J cars will open on the Polo CroundH j
to-day, wheal the Yanl.tt will light the
Boston Bed Sox for tho temporary pos- (
session of first place In the American
League. The Bed Sox start the series
two panics In front, but the Yankees
must win four Nlrahjlit games In order i
to emerge from the scrlen In first Place.
Tho Yankees have won their last four 1
games from Boston, but prior to that .
lloston look four In a run'. Hence the
two clubs arc oven. The Bed Sox, how
ever, have still to win a gamo on tho
Polo Grounds this seanon.
Miller lkisglns, tho Yankco leader,
was highly eUled over tho fai l that lie ,
lost no ground to the leaders"" while they 1
were plsyjng the Athletics. Tho .Mack
men had been going so badly on their
Western trip that little was expected
from them In the vv-av of stooping the .
Sox, especially as the crimson bote
plaer"" always are at their best In T'en- I
way Park. But the Athletics held Bos. '
ton to nn oven break, the same that the
Yankees got In their series with Wash- '
Ington. In the form that Walter John- '
son Is In at present any club will bo
doing well to jtct an even break vvlth the
Senators.
Iloth the Yanks and lied Sox are well
primed for the series, and some Intercst-
ln- games should ensue.

slow up a bit. and If the baseball races
are not broken up by Hen. Cionder tho
National League race may still reole
Into an Interesting free for all, with Chi
cago, New York anil lloston the leading
contenders.
Dodgers Plnsliisr Fine Ilfill.
The work of the Rrooklyn club Is ile-
i serving of the highest praise. Despite
the fact that the club has been i educed
I to fourteen men and Is depending nn a
I pitching staff, of which only four men
pave any baseball experience, the club
is playing fine ball. Were It not for the
handicap or Its poor start, the team
some wonderful work for the IVnlgers
and Is pitching us well as when he was
In his prime.
The Cincinnati club continues to chute
the chutes and Is the mystery of the lot.

FALL DATE LIKELY
, FOR OPEN TOURNEY
Proposed Visit of British Golf
ers Expected to Delay Play
for Championship.
' iir innis nnftwx.
When the United States Golf Associa
tion lipids its annual meeting horn
January 9, among lis duties will be the
selection of courses and dates for tho
tliree tournaments the amateur, open
and womcn'B championships. Thus far
nothing definite as to llkdy selections of
Bites has been announced, nor have the
probable dates been made known, in
one respect, however, It Is likely that
next season will differ from the pMt one.
In all probability the National Open
Championship will be dropped ,ftrtb.er
down on tho calendar than the posit on
occupied last spring.- The consideration
favoring such a move Is the wected I In
vasion of tho States by British golfers
Unless unforeseen conditions i arise to
prevent their coming. Harry Vardon J.
11. Taylor. Abe Mitchell and James
Braid, and possibly ono or two o hers of
Britain first class profess onals pro
pose to visit this country next summer.
Prior to their coming here some of
America's topnotchcrs are planning a
trip to the other side. Walter Hagen
Tom McNamara, and probably two or
three more, will make up an Invading
party In quest of British go f laurels
Thev expect to go over early In the
rtw. surtlng about the first week In
April? During their stay abroad they
expect to-'engago In niuneroue Mb It on
matches and will also take a filer at the
BrltlBh Open championship.
JIny Compete In Nntloiinl Open.
Following this event these players
will return home In time to take part
In the National Open here, Provided of
course, the date Is set far enough along
In the season to allow then to get back.
At the same time the visiting players
naturally will want to spend somo time
here, playing over courses In this coun
try and getting ns fully accustomed to
conditions as possible.
The above plans for reciprocal visits
by the I leading professional talent of
America' and Great Britain will stim
ulate deep interest In the two big tour
naments. It will mark the first appear
ance of Champion Walter Hagen abroad.
Sumner R, Hollander, who has returned
from England, states that Hagen Is the
man that English golfers fear most of
all our stars.. Naturally they are wait
ing to be shown Just what ho can do on
English courses. At the same time they
are ready to accord him considerable
prestige on what he has done here.
On the other hand, the proposed visit
next surnmer will at the same time
mark the first appearance here of Abe
Mitchell, who Is rated by many the best
golfer on the other side Just now, and j
probably the last visit of Harry Vardon.
Recent happenings on the other side
have opened the question as' to whether
or not Vardon, along with Duncan Braid
and Taylor, has not begun to go back,
and Is no longer tho fine golfer that he
uncc was.
Vardon Uagcr to Vlitt U. S.
Vardon himself laughs at the Idea of
such a thing. But at the same time he
feels that it won't be many more sea
sons before time begins to lay a heavy
hand on him, and he wants to make ono
mors visit dver here while he still feels
that he Is good enough to make a real
fight for the best tho game has to offer
anywhere. The coming of the British
delegation Is, thorefore, suro to add
. V i V . j .L j, . ""
Interest far beyond the ordinary to our
next open champtcnshlp.
Tom McNamari. Tom Kerrigan and
Jack Dowllng, the Scarsdale profes
sional, are planning to start before very
long for a trip to the Pacific Coast.
The three expoct to visit several golfing
centres In California and the Far West
shortly after the first of the year and
will then come ba?!c Hast via a Southern
route, reaching Florida and later Plnc
hurst In time for the big events there.
Jim Barnes will nlso visit California
for a while .before he heads south Into
Florida for the big open events there.

Havana, Cuba, Dec. 23. The racing
at Oriental Park to-day was decided
ly tame. The winners In the first four
events had things all their way and won
easily. Torkvllle, in the third race,
made It two ln a row when he spread
eagled his field to win by ten lengths.
The result was never in doubt after the
start Pierrot was second, four lengths
before Ambassador III. Quln, ln the
opening event scored very easily when
he led home his field by eight lengths,
defeating Count Boris, the hot favorite.
Native Soil was third, three lengths
back.
Peaceful Star, the receding favorite,
was returned the winner in the second
race, leading Prince Direct to the wire
by two lengths. Tim J. Hogan was
third.
Annabellc, well playel, won the fourth
race by a length and a half from Major
Bradley, which closed with a rush.
The finish In the fifth was very -jlose,
the first three horses coming to the fin
ish necks apart Bill Hunley gained the
decision, with O'Malley second and Tack
Healy third.

Breeze Hangs Up Another
Record at New Qrleans
Clips Full Second From One; Mile Track Mark at Jef
ferson Park Bon Tromp Wins
the Teche Purse.
SptctalDtipateh to Tni 3m.
New OnucANR, Dec. 23. Balmy
weather and palmy racing proved grati
fying' to the comparatively imall at
tendance, at Jefferson! Park to-day.
Breeze, frequent winner tat the, meet,
proved himself a better horse than he
had yet shown by accounting for the Sa
bine Handicap, tho feature of the pro
gramme, lie clipped a full second from
the, mile record, the only one which had
not been shattered before at this meet
ing. Breeze's performance was Impressive.
Ho was Impeded at the start and forced
to easo up when Coltllettl slid off Tailor
Maid. Clifford Robinson then raced
htm after his field and Into close quar
ters through tho backstretch, while
Trusty wan In front lengths away.
Approaching tho turn Robinson saw
an opening and applied the lash, to
which Breeze responded by racing
around Lively and Jack Mount and, tak
ing the lead from Trusty at the stretch,
went on and beat home'all except the
rldcrlees Tailor Maid.
Jack Mount had little difficulty dis
posing of the tiring Trusty for place
honors, while the othors were beaten
off. With good racing luck Breeze might
have created a greater dent In the old
record.
The Teche purse served as the com
panion feature and fell to Bon Tromp,
also ridden by Robinson. He was a
slight favorite In tho speculation and
held sway throughout tho six furlongs
Journey, winning handily from Harry
Burgoyne, which had always been his
closest attendant. The Eastern dele
gation suffered from the defeat of Tick
lish, which finished a poor fifth, after
having failed to extend himself. After
the finish it became apparent that he
had suffered a recurrence of the hoof
trouble that affected his late metropoli
tan performances.
The third was captured by the Bux
ton Confederacy's Edith It In a driving
finish from the faint hearted Miss Par
noil. The contest was marred by a very
ragged Btart, which affected all except
the placed horses. Neenah was the
worst ruftercr nnd ran a winning race.
Fifteen maidens faced the barrier In
the oriencr and a close finish re'sulted
when Emma J. scored over Virginia
D'Or nnd Fledgling, which pulled up
lame.

Is no scarcity of birds, but to decoy them
Is another matter.
Congratulations for Mr. Hoover.
Statistics now coming to light as to the
number of deer killed the last season and
the proportion of females to malea killed
no doubt will prove' very gratifying to the
advocates of the one deer law.
If, as somir have stated, forty per cent,
of the deer In the titate have been ex
terminated, they may rightfully claim that
from their point of Mew the last season
hao been highly successful.
Undoubtedly If the present law remains
ln force another year and they profit by
the mistakes of the past season tha other
sixty per cent, may bo killed. This result
would then make tha season one hundred
per cent, perfect.
Let all tru sportsmen congratulate M

Cotch of 45 Trout Aide Conservation.
Charles P. Dorff has seen tit to pralaa
the gentleman who captured forty-five
trout from Esopus Creek.
I admire your courage. Mr. Dorfi. I
sure do. 80 you really believe your friend
Is a good sportnnanf Would you mind
giving .me your definition of a fish hog7
Do you realise that your friend waa catch
Ing a trout at the rate bf about one ovcry
nve mlnutea during his four hour sojourn
on ths Esopus, and this taking Into con
sideration th"" time he spent mopping hla
brow and easing his aching arm? Geel
How he must have travelled!
Another thing; It Is practically lm
possible to catch forty-nve trout from a
stream the slzo of tho Esopus in any ono
day and keep within the law ""Search
Me"" to the contrary.
If ""Search Me"" has ever fished tho
stream In question surely he knows that
In such a large catch thero wouldn't bs
near twenty-nine trout around six or seven
Inches In length. I doubt very much If
any angler, fishing Esopus Creek, could
stow away such a ""flock"" of trout without
noticing a few over twelve Inches and
qulto a number nine or ten Inches long.
I have no ""bone"" to pick with ""Search
Me."" The fact that he Is for a minimum
length of eight Inches and twenty-five In
number shows his heart to be In the right
place, no matter It he did try to get a
man out of a nasty ""mess.""
However, I will give your friend Mr.
Dorff this much credit: Ho has, uncon
sciously, started something; ho has done
more for conservation In four hours than
ur.y other man could do In a lifetime, A
new law limiting a catch of trout to
twenty-five in number and perhaps seven
or eight Inches In length will, I beilee,
be the consequence.

Proper Method of Handling Deer Meat.
The California Fish and Game Commis
sion tells what to do with a deer.
To transport a deer on a saddle horse
throw a rope across the saddle, pulling a
loop of it forward through each cinch ring.
Placo tho buck across the saddle and
put the head through one loop and ths
haunches through the other.
Draw the enls of the rope tight, make
a loop In ono, reeve tho other through It
and make fast.
To skin a deer head for mounting, cut
the skin around tne neck well down on
the snoulder and breast.
Then cut e.ong the upper side of the
neck to the top of the head. Thence
make diagonal cuts, one to each horn.
Cut off the ears close to tho skull, turn
them Inside out, and cut a,vay the meat,
leaving the cartilage. Skin carefully
around he eyes. Cut the lii close to ths
skull, leaving them attached to tho akin.
Split them from the. inside and fill the cut
with salt.
Rub plenty of salt into the flesh side
of nil parts of the skin and let It dry
slowly In the shade or roll it up hair aide
In and ship at once to a taxidermist.
To butcher a deer, hang It up by the
hind legs, split the skin along the middle
of tne breast and belly and to the end of
the tall, then along the inside of each leg.
Cut off the feet at the Jolnta and peel
off the skin. Cut through the wall of the
abdomen without piercing the Intestines:
loostn the diaphragm at the back and
sides; cut away the lower Intestine close
to the bone and empty out the entire con
tents of the carcass. Split the breastllne
with a hatchet.
The best cuts of venison are the saddle
and haunch,
Tn mnlco lerlced venison or ""Jerkv"" use
lean meat cut Into strips about one half
Inch wide, Lay IhoSo aide uy side on a
frame made of slats or poles, supported
about four feet from the ground and keep
a small smokv fire eolng underneath until
the meat Is thoroughly dry
Fresh meat should be hung up and pro
tected from flies bv cheesecloth.

Strength on Field Against
""Praying Colonels.''
By William Abbott.
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Oct. II. Be
fore a crowd of more than 60,000
fipectatora and under weather condi
tions Idea for fnnthnll wltli tlm mm
high and bright nnd n crisp north
west breeze cutting ncross the Held
thj Harvard and Centre College
elevens clashed hcrr thin uftornoo.
In tho deciding gamo of their thrco
eason Intorsecttonal nerles. Because
of the stand of the presidents cf tho
""Big Three,"" Harvard, Yule und
Princeton, against tho continuation of
Interactional grid contests this will
probably mark tho Hnal appearance
horo for somo time to come of the.
sensational cloven from tho little
Southern college.
Fired by u determination that tho
Praying Colonels imiMt not depart
with a vietory that the near future
promises little clmncn to redeem tho
Crimson threw its full strength on tlic
Held for the fray to-day. Centre,
while minus Mm great McMillan at
luarlorback, wan able to present no
less than seven of tho veterans or
last years' combination which sent
Harvard down Inst year under a fi
to 0 deleat. Jleili Covington piloted
tho visitors a McMillan's successor
and Captain ""Red"" Itobcrts started
thr gnnw .it fullbar'
No ouo could bo t . ind in the visit
ing paity who would predict a victory
oyer Harvard. ""Ited"" llrlierts, nll
Arncrlcan end in 1921 and now bigger
thun ever, expressed tho vluwprlnt of
tho Kentucktans when he told the
writer: ""Wo all know lho prepara
tions Harvard has mado for tho game,
but wo are hopefu! it mai:lng a good
showing ""
Coach Moran frankly admitted he's
had a hard tiino rcol'icloc; '.lie loss of
McMIIIln, James and other stars from
tho 1021 combination that conquered
thu Crimson. After a disappointing
loelopment tho sanad arrUcd hcio
badly crippled for its most Important
battlo of the season.
Tho KentucklaiiH' hqiiad numbeis
twenty- rive, but their reserve- pinc
ers iiro not imposing, and as is tlic'.r
custom, tho ""Praying Colonels"" bo
foio going Into action this afternoon
had better otfer a special prayer to
tho foloball gods to sparo them from
further casualties, as thu leinalning
regulars can't bo spared. .
In addition to Injuries and the ne
cessity of playing an Inexperienced
combination, the resisting hnnd of
tradition Is ralsod against tho Ken
tucktans for their third encounter
with tho Crimson. Ever slnco Har
vard llrst played football tho Cam
bridge Institution has never lost In
consecuUvo years to tho same oppo
nent, on Soldiers' Field. .
Hack In 1903, In tho opening gamo
at tho Stadium, Dartmouth emerged
victoriously. in latter years tho
Curllslo Indians scalped tho Cara-
btldgo playors, but all during tho
"" period to 1931, when Centre triumphed
over a Harvard, ino opponent over re
turned tho following year and licked
tho Johnny Harvards.

THE FORD LEADS
AT SECOND I
FISHERMAN'S RACE
Officials Postpone Contest,
but Captains Disregard Sig
nals and Start Off.
GLOUCESTER, Mass.. Oct. 21
(Associated Press). Henry Ford took
ii lead of 100 yards over tho Canadian
H.uenoso at tho start of the llrst In
ternational fisherman's raco to-day.
Iioth Captains had disregarded tho
Raco Commlttco's signal to postpono
tho start to 10:30 o'clock. '
At 10:10, with tho Honry Ford en
joying a lead of a quarter of a mile,
tho judges sent out a recall but both
skippers kept on tho courbde
Tho Judges started after tho
schooners evidently with tho Idea of
letting tho Captains havo their way
of calling It a raco. Oft Milk Island,
three miles from tho llrst turn, tho
Mucnoso began to gain on tho Ford
and at 10:15 both woro fairly on even
terms, running beforo tho breczo with
their sails wing and wing.
Tho course wa3 a flve-mllo run to
the llrst mark, tcn-milo reach off
shore, a beat of ten mllca to tho
third mark, a tcn-milo run to tho
fourth mark, and a flvc-rallo beat to
tho llnlsh.
A motorboat was sent out to tho
Ford from cno of tho coast guard
cutters, but Capt. Morrisscy rerused
to return.
At 10.30 both boats uppioached tho
first turn, running beforo thu wind
with their staysails scandalized. Tho
Ford was well In the lead.
The time around tho first maik

Last year it gave the\nJ.C.S. a chairman and President\nTruman put General Omar N.\nBradley in the job. The J.C.S.\ndecides where to hold atomic\nbombs in readiness, where to sta\ntion bomber groups and picket\nsubmarines, where to set up the\nradar-warning net. It has a war\nplan to fit 1950 conditions, but its\neyes are on 1952 and later, when\nRussia\u2019s atomic stockpile will be\nbig enough to make present plans\nuseless.\nThe eight posts in the cold-war\ngovernment mentioned so far are\nnew; the remaining two are long\nestablished:\n9. Diplomatic Weapons: The\nsecurity of the United States is, of\ncourse, the fundamental business\nof Secretary Dean Acheson\u2019s De\npartment of State. But Acheson is\nalso a member of the National\nSecurity Council. When President\nTruman is away, he presides.\n10. Costs of the Cold War:\nBudget Director Frank Pace\u2019s job\nis to keep a wary eye on spending;\nthe cold war is the costliest peace\ntime undertaking in U. S. history.\nPace has been handicapped by\nlack of long-range planning in the\nNational Security Council.\nThis, then, is our cold-war gov\nernment. On paper it looks pretty\ngood \u2014 well-planned, efficient\nsounding, nothing much left out.\nBut in practice, over the last three\nyears, two serious dangers have\ncome to light.\nDanger No. I lies with the cold\nwar machine itself. It is there on\npaper all right, but it isn't all\nassembled yet. It\u2019s like an auto\nmobile wit a horn but no brakes,\nwith an engine and gasoline, but,\noften as not, no driver behind the\nwheel. Here are some examples:\n\u2022 The National Security Council\nhas failed so far to come up with\na long-range security policy into\nwhich all other plans will fit.\n\u2022 The National Security Resources\nBoard at the time this was written\nhad been without a permanent\nchairman since December 15,1948.\n\u2022 In its short life the Research\nand Development Board has had\nto operate under three different\nchairmen.\n\u2022 The Atomic Energy Commis\nsion lost its permanent chairman,\nDavid Lilienthal, in February. As\nthis was written no new chairman\nhad been appointed.\n'\u2022 The Central Intelligence\nAgency has flubbed its biggest\nassignment, keeping tabs on\nRussia\u2019s atomic program.\nWhile this obviously is difficult, it\nis also obvious that the Russian\nbomb caught U. S. planners flat\nfooted.\nOn the good side the National\nSecurity Council has dealt effec\ntively with emergencies, typically\nin its decision two years ago tc\nhold the line against Russia in\nGermany with the Berlin airlift,\nand in its decision last year to\ngive economic support to Marshal\nTito in Yugoslavia.\nDanger Mo. 2 lies in the present\ndrift toward secrecy. Nine of the\n10 top cold-war jobs (all except\nthe Budget Director) are essenti\nally secret jobs. Much of the work\nmust be kept from enemy eyes.\nThe trouble here is that the con\ndition of U. S. security is also kept\nfrom the U. S. public. And neces\nsary or not, such a state of affairs\nis highly dangerous to a democ\nracy. Secrecy and freedom just\ndon\u2019t mix.\nWhat can be done about these\ntwo dangers?\nThe first is obvious, and some\ncorrection is probably on the way.\nThe vacant top jobs on the\nNational Security Resources\nBoard and the Atomic Energy\nCommission should be filled. The\nN.S.R.B. should get on with its\nM-Day plans for man-power and\nindustrial mobilization, for raw\nmaterial stockpiling, for atomic\nbomb city defenses, and for decen\ntralization of industry and govern\nment in wartime. The Central\nIntelligence Agency should be\nstrengthened.\nuanger ino. i is a lot naraer to\ncombat. You can\u2019t tell Americans\nwhat\u2019s going on and at the same\ntime keep potential enemies from\nfinding out. But something can\nbe done, all the same, to check\nthe present drift toward more\nsecrecy and less freedom.\nThe Committee for Economic\nDevelopment, an organization of\nbusiness leaders and others, is one\ngroup that is seriously worried\nabout this problem. Recently it\ncame up with some sense-making\nsuggestions.\nJob for a Civilian\nWhat did the C.E.D. suggest?\nFirst, that we should strengthen\nthe civilian control of our cold\nwar organization. Civilians, not\nmilitary men, should decide how\nfar secrecy is allowed to go. Sec\nond, the President should appoint\nthree new full-time members to\nthe National Security Council,\nwith cabinet rank. One of these\nmen would represent the public.\nHis job would be to inform people,\njust as far as safety allows, on how\nthe cold war is going.\nAmerica\u2019s cold-war government\nis still new and untried. Some of its\nsecrecy is certainly necessary. The\nproblem is where to draw the line.\nMost Americans want to be\ntold as much as possible. The\nstrength of democracy has always\ncome from free men working freely\ntogether. It is the terrible respon\nsibility of these 10 men to act so\nthat this shall never be impaired.\nCongress and the citizens have\ntheir responsibilities too\u2014to make\nthis new machinery work.

These men head up America\u2019s cold-war government, an\norganization that very few people in the country know much\nabout.\nIn 1947 Congress passed a terribly important and little\nunderstood law. One part of this la* \u201cunified\u201d the armed\nforces into the Department of Defense and everybody heard a\nlot about that. A more important part of the law set up the\ncold-war government and not too much was said about it,\nthen or since.\nOur own painful experience in World War II led to the\npassage of this law, called the National Security Act of 1947.\nThe idea was that next time, if there is a next time, war will\nhit us quickly and hit us at home. We\u2019ll have no time to get\nready; we\u2019ll have to be ready. The National Security Act laid\nout a scheme for keeping the United States in a state of readi\nness.\nThe trouble is this scheme, which needs so desperately to\nsucceed, hasn\u2019t worked out very well so far. And one impor\ntant reason, we believe, is lack of public understanding.\nThat\u2019s why you should have a look at the cold-war govern\nment setup. Here is the situation as this issue goes to press:\nwho the top 10 are and what they are supposed to do.\n1. Tho Cold-Wax High Command: The new National\nSecurity Council is a five-man super-cabinet with a single\nassignment: the safety of the United States. President Tru\nman admits that he doesn\u2019t see how other presidents got along\nwithout it.\nTruman himself heads the National Security Council; other\npermanent members are the Vice-President, the Secretary of\nState, the Secretary of Defense and the chief of the National\nSecurity Resources Board. One great question that is always\nbefore the Council is this:\n1- H\u00aew Starng b The Emmy? The eyes and ears of the\nNational Council are in the new Central Intelligence Agency.\nIts ticklish job is to ferret out the secrets of America\u2019s enemies;\nC.I.A.\u20198 undercover agents are at work in every one of the\nnations behind the Iron Curtain.\nBoss of the C.I.A. is Rear Admiral Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter.\nHis staff includes former O.S.S. men, Army and Navy intelli\ngence officers and a carefully recruited corps of foreign agents.\nBut so far C.I.A. hasn\u2019t done too well. More of that in a\nmoment.\n3- How Strong b TV* U. S.? Bitter experience in World\nWar II taught us that we must know our own strength right\ndown to the last man and machine, and plan for war accord\ningly. The new National Security Resources Board has this\nplanning job. Under new M-Day legislation, now in prepara\ntion, if an enemy strikes, the country will go on a war footing\novernight. A stop-order will halt production of civilian goods;\nprices and rents will freeze; taxes will skyrocket; a labor draft\nwill go into action.\nThe N.S.R.B., like the National Security Council, is a\nContinued on page 37", "batch": "dlc_2kandinsky_ver01", "title_normal": "evening star.", "url": "https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1950-04-16/ed-1/seq-100.json", "place": ["District of Columbia--Washington"], "page": "5"}, {"sequence": 6, "county": ["Halifax"], "edition": null, "frequency": "Daily (except Saturday)", "id": "/lccn/sn91068749/1948-12-08/ed-1/seq-6/", "subject": ["North Carolina--Roanoke Rapids.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01220065", "Roanoke Rapids (N.C.)--Newspapers."], "city": ["Roanoke Rapids"], "date": "19481208", "title": "Roanoke Rapids daily herald.", "end_year": 1949, "note": ["Also published as: Daily herald.

IWOO\nHow Not to Win\nYour Cold War\nAS ANOTHER winter approaches, Americans are getting set\nL to fight a whole new cold war. Each year, along with the\nfirst spate of chilly-weather sniffles, comes a rash of medical\nand pseudo-medical advice on prevention and treatment of\nthe common cold. But with or without advice, Americans still\nsuffer through 500 million miserable colds a year and spend\nclose to $220 million on medical aids and doctor bills. In ad\ndition colds cost industry abopt $5 billion annually in lost\ntime, lowered production, and decreased efficiency of men and\nwomen who trudge to work anyway, despite runny noses and\naccompanying miseries.\nIs there any hope for the anguished cold sufferer? Most\nexperts in the field think so. But they are cautious in their\noptimism, forecasting at best a vaccine which would be effec\ntive in 75 per cent of all colds And even this is not likely for\nanother decade.\nAccording to medical consensus, the best defense against\na cold is good resistance. Too many victims try every nostrum\nin the book after they've caught a cold rather than taking that\nall-important ounce of prevention which might have warded\noff a virus rampage. While there is no sure way of avoiding a\ncold, there are certain time-tested ways to make it more likely\nyou will catch one, and some of these are demonstrated here by\nViola Heller, production line worker for Du Pont in Pompton\nLakes, N. J. While the situations illustrated are definitely to\nbe avoided if possible, nearly everybody gets into one or more\nof them in winter. If a cold follows, you\u2019ll at least have the satis\nfaction of guessing what helped it on its way.\n.'3MBBBBHBK# T ' ' 7*\n2*' \\X\n| 1 -*3Hp\nHowever pleasant it is, keeping late hours and eating low\nvitamin food can make you over-tired and undernourished.", "batch": "dlc_capra_ver01", "title_normal": "evening star.", "url": "https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1960-12-04/ed-1/seq-232.json", "place": ["District of Columbia--Washington"], "page": "44"}, {"sequence": 13, "county": [null], "edition": null, "frequency": "Daily", "id": "/lccn/sn83045462/1952-10-03/ed-1/seq-13/", "subject": ["Washington (D.C.)--fast--(OCoLC)fst01204505", "Washington (D.C.)--Newspapers."], "city": ["Washington"], "date": "19521003", "title": "Evening star.

It will be the:\nopening session of the 19th con-j\ngress of the Communist Party\u2014\nthe ruling tool of the Kremlin. I\nThe Communist decisions which\nwill come out of this new party\nThe writer of this orticle, a former\ncounselor of the Soviet foreign officn\nand on official in the Soviet govern\nment tor 20 years, probably has tha\nmost extensive knowledge of Kremlin\npolicies of any Russian escopee yet to\nreach the United States.\ncongress\u2014the first in 13 years\u2014\nundoubtedly will confront the\nfree world with some grave shift\nin Russian policy. This policy\ns lift can take the form of a new\n\"peace\" offensive or a new \u201cKo\nrea\u201d in the Middle East or some\nwhere in Europe.\nAs a former Soviet official who\nhas attended such a previous con\ngress. I can testify first hand and\ntiiat the Communist bosses would\nnot have called a new congress\nunless some important and\ndramatic measure was about to\nhe launched. In the past, the\nCommunists have called their j\nparty congresses usually in con\nnection with some major de\nparture or development in Com\nmunist Party policies.\nThe last congress, held in Mos\ncow in 1939, preceded the Rus\nsian pact with Adolph Hitler. It\nwas a sensational departure from\nprevious policy.\nThough the Communist con\ngress is advertised by Moscow' as\nthe \u201chighest authority\" in the\nland, its real role actually is only\nto serve as a rubber stamp. It is\ncalled, in effect, merely to ap\nprove decisions already arrived\nat by Premier Joseph Stalin and\nthe Politburo.\nDecisions Top Secret.\nFor example, the last congress\nwnich I attended as a member of\nthe Soviet Foreign Office was an\nInterim congress held shortly be\nfore the war. The Communist\nParty functionaries, who came as\ndelegates from all over the Soviet\nUnion, were told that a clash with\nKnotty Pine Bedroom\ntin\nYour Choice\u2014Each Piece JiJI II\n- IM-1'- ZLM\n_ I g r I\ng 1 ' :\nfree customer parking Arranged\nOPEN MONDAY AND\nThursday nites aaBMEWWBgvMnjiHBHI\ntil 9\nStore Hours\n9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.\nHitler was imminent. They were,\ndirected to start to put the Rus\nsian economy on a war footing:\nimmediately.\nAt that time, of course, these\nmajor decisions were a top-se\ncret matter. They never were,\nj published.\nI The same will be true of the\ncurrent congress. The decisions\nreached will be treated as secret, j\nYou may be sure that what is\nDublished will not be the real\ndecisions.\nHowever, that does not mean\nthat the free world can ignore\nthe congress as unimportant.\nThough the Communist Party in\nRussia is considered as a mili\n. tary unit, with ironclad discip\n. line, and with no free discussion\n: allowed of policies already\n, reached by the party bosses, the,\nproblem of public psychology re\n\u25a0 mains.\nMust Prepare Terrain.\nThe terrain must oe prepared:\nUhe party must be alerted to mobi\nlize public opinion behind the\nnew policies. Thus , the West\ni should be on the watch, after\nI this current congress, for pos\nsible attempts to switch Russian\n[ public opinion one way or the\n'other\n'j It is possible, for instance, that\n1 an entirely new \u201cpeace offensive\u201d\nI may be started immediately after\n\u2022 i this Communist congress to lull\n\u25a0the West into forgetting the pos-l\nisibility of war. The Kremlin!\nmight try to bluff the free world\ninto thinking that no general war\n; is likely or possible. It might try\n1 to cause a split between Western\nEurope and America over the re-:\narmament program.\n> This split between allies,'\nnaturally, is the main core of\n\u2019 Stalin diplomacy. In 1939 Stalin\n\u2022 was able to split the West by!\nhis pact with Hitler.\n1| Why shouldn't he again try to\n\u25a0 split the West by a pact, for in-;\n: stance, with the British govern\niment, this time under the guise\ni'of some innocent appearing \u201ctrade\n[ pact \u201d\nl However, Tdo not rule out the'\n\u25a0 possibility that a new \u201cKorea\u201d\nmight emerge after this latest\nil Moscow party congress.\nWhen you have an enemy whose\ni! whole conception of life and whose\n, total efforts are directed toward\nthe eventual annihilation of the\n[\u201ccapitalist west,\u201d you should ex\nipect nothing but \u201cblood, sweat\nand tears\u201d from a gathering of\nCommunist bosses.\nFooled in \u201cCold War.\u201d\n! The Kremlin masters already\nhave succeeded in fooling the West\nabout one very important thing.\nIt's the \u201ccold war.\u201d The Krem\nlin has bluffed virtually every\nWestern diplomat into thinking\nthat the \u201ccold war\u201d started shortly\nafter World War 11.\nThat discovery by British dip\nlomats and others of the actual\nexistence of a \u201ccold war\u201d against\nthe West came at least 35 years\ntoo late.\nIf by the term cold war is\nmeant a war of nerves, an open\nCommunist war against humanity,\nagainst all the free nations of\n'he world, such a Western belief\nis sheer nonsense.\nI can testify, as a former So\nviet official, that the \u201ccold war\"\nwas proclaimed by the Com\nmunists against the free world\n35 yeais ago.\nThat marks the date of the\nCommunists\u2019 first great success,\nthe 1917 October revolution in\nRussia, which marked the seizure\nof the first nation by Marxist\nfanatics, bent on a violent re\nmaking of the whole world.\nOn that day, October 25. 1917.\nNikolai Lenin and Stalin pro\nclaimed openly the beginning of\na Communist crusade for the con\nquest of the world and for the\ntotal transformation of away of\nlife of the whole world.\nConsolidated Themselves.\nNo one, of course, paid any\nattention. Nobody cared to heed\nthe fanatic prophecies of a bunch\nof unknown adventures in a land\nwhich the West always considered\nlas rather strange and remote.\nBut look what happened. The\nCommunists in Russia were left\nto build up quietly, over the years,\na \u201csituation of strength\"\u2014 as is\nnow the fashionable expression\nj among diplomats.\nThe Communists exterminated\nRussia national opposition and\nschism within their own' ranks.\n\u2022They consolidated themselves\npolitically.\nThey exploited the giant mate\nrial and human resources of one i\nthe biggest and richest coun-i\ntries in the world. Then, they!\nlaunched their big offensive!\nagainst the West.\nOnly after the seizure of the'\nBaltic and the Balkan countre:.|\nof the great portion of central\nEurope and of most of mannanu'\nof Asia, including China, did the\nWest realize that the world was\n;in a \u201ccold war.\u201d\nIn a second and final article\ntomorrow: How a Communist\ncongress work.\nLafayette Park Tour\nTops Parks' Program\n1 Lafayette Park, with its historic\nsurroundings, will be toured to- :\nmorrow under auspices of the Na\ntional Capital Parks Office.\nStanley W.

Already\n|3 the spokesmen for\nRB the interests who\nW would throw two\nthirds of the our\nfarmers to wolves\nhave turned their\nguns on the fea\n3\u00c9 tures of the pro\ngram most help\nful to those farmers in the lower\nbrackets who need a guaranteed in\ncome the most.\nAs the battle continues they will\ncontinue to pour more emery dust\ninto the bearings,\nleaders who have been taking a\n\"let Brannan do it for us\" atti\nIf the farm\ntude don't get together and plan\ntheir strategy for mass mobiliza\ntion in support of the interests of\nthe family farmers they are in for\na rude awakening.\nThe lead editorial headed \"Bran\nnan's Brainstorm,\" in the big busi\nness Chicago Journal of Commerce,\nafter the secretary announced his\nprogram, smearingly concluded that,\n\"if it is ever written into law, we can\nstop talking about 'soft socialism' for\nthe hard variety known in Russia will\nhe with us in fact.\" Some farm lead\ners who wine and dine with big busi\nness men and who have long since\ndiscarded their shoes with the tattle\ntale barn yard smell, have joined the\nchorus against Brannan and his pro\ngram.\nOne of the good features in the\nBrannan program is the proposal\nto give consumers the benefit of\nlow prices when certain of the non\nstorable commodities are down in\nprice either from long supplies or\nother reasons. Lower prices to\nconsumers means a broader market\nfor farmers. Prices to farmers\nwill be supported with federal pro\nduction payments.\nThus if it is determined that a\ngiven grade of range cattle, for ex\nample, should fetch the farmer $15\nper hundred pounds under the pro\ngram and the market price at which\ncattle sold had dropped to $11, the\ngovernment would make up the dif\nference to the farmer of $4 per\nhundred. At what price top quality\nrange yearlings should be supported\nis something about which there will\nbe much dispute. Without a doubt\nthe figures set by Brannan's brain\ntrust will be too low to prevent thous\nands of the narrow margin ranchers\nfrom going under. And the same for\nthe other commodities. The break\neven price for all farming opera\ntions is now much higher then ever.\nBig Business doesn't want the little\nfarmers to have any price supports\nat all. If they go busted they are\nlabelled as inefficient and should\nquit to make room for the \"Get-Rich\nLand and Cattle Company.\"\nAnother feature of the Brannan\nprogram that certainly is correct\nis the principle of price guarantees\nfor only a certain amount or a cer\ntain number of production units\nfor each farm. It is set at 1,800\nunits. Production over and above\n1,800 units will not be supported\nand the farmer will receive for it\nonly the actual market price. This\nis aimed at the large operators\nwho have been in favor of no-par\nity or low-parity price supports.\nBut it lets all but two per cent of\nthe farmers into the program and\n75 per cent of the total farm pro\nduction.\nThe principle of acreage reduction\nor marketing reduction as a require\nment for getting benefits from the\nprogram will certainly work a hard\nship on the little farmers. Most of\nthem do not have enough land or pro\nduce enough now to make a decent\nliving. Another quite evident fea\nture of the program is that King\nCotton will ' retain all the stars in\nhis crown while the sharecropper who\ndoes all the work will still be doing\nall the work and his standard of liv\nof its support and over these Clag\nThe\ning will not be raised one whit.\nAdministration depends on the South\nern Democrats in congress for much\nhorns King Cotton rides herd.\nThe key to the whole farm prob\nlem today is keeping farm income\nfor the lower two-thirds of the farm\nup high enough so the hungry\nwolf will keep his distance from the\nfarmer's door. The hungry wolf rep\nresents tractor fuel, seed, fertilizer,\nrent, taxes, interest, living costs\u2014\noperating expenses. If farm income\nis not kept up the wolf will be up\ntearing a leg off the farmer every\ntime he comes out of the house to\nturn a wheel. It is doubtful if the\nBrannan program is too concerned\nabout the real small farmers\u2014those\nwho are the worst off.\nOn the whole there will be a\ntough fight to get any sort of a de-,\ncent farm program. Much tougher\nthan the progressive-minded farm\ners who go along with Truman and\nBrannan think. They will have to\nget a lot of support from outside\nof their own ranks. They should\nappeal to labor, now with a foot in\nthe Taft-Hartley bear trap,\nlabor leaders should not find it\ners\nThe\ndifficult to win their memberships\nover to a farm program that will\nmean lower prices for consumers.\nWith labor support for the farm\nmeasures the farmers will more\nreadily support labor's demand for\nthe repeal of Taft-Hartley and the\nre-enactment of the Wagner Act.\nNAZI PARTY IS REVIVED\nFrankfurt, Germany, April 6\u2014An\naggressive political party with many\nof the trappings and principles of\nthe Nazis is rising in western Ger\nmany, official Allied intelligence re\nports showed today.\nIntelligence officers, citing docu\nments from their files, said the small\nbut growing German Rightist party\n(DRP) is in many respects a neo\nNazi movement.\u2014 G.

How would you like to play\na ball game where your teammates\nstepped up to the plate and the um\nire yelled \"two strikes\" before the\npitcher had made the first pitch?\nThat is what the Taft-Hartley bill,\nwritten by a corporation lawyer,\nwho was paid by the Republican\nNational Committee, does to union\nlabor. Bill is being debated this\nweek in the house. Write your let\nter or card today.\n* \u00bb\nThe Livingston Chamber of Com\nmerce has passed a resolution con\ndemning the government (which is\nall of us) going into the power busi\nness and destroying the private util\nities. The monies taken from your\npay check, income taxes, etc., all go\ninto the U.S. treasury\u2014a big jack\npot; and is not earmarked for any\nexpenditure. When the government\nbuilds a dam, builds power trans\nmission lines and delivers the juice\nto public utilities, cities, towns, REA,\netc., at a low rate instead of turning\nthe juice over to private power com\npanies for a fraction of a cent, and\nwhich they resell at twelve hundred\nor more percent profit to you, the\nprivate power companies say that is\nall wrong. It is okeh for government\nto build the dams but the private\ncompanies should handle the output.\nThat argument is as senseless as a\nfarmer buying a thorough-bred cow,\nbreeding her to a famous sire. He\nkeeps the calf but every day he gives\nthe milk free to a milkman to distrib\nute and collect the profits,\ndon't make sense.\nMurray fighting for government\nowned dams and transmission lines\nwhile D'Ewart and Ecton oppose\nsame.\nJust\nMansfield and\nRep.

Nourse of the\nPresident's Council of Economic Ad\nvisers recently called attention to the\neconomic dangers inherent in the de\nveloping cold war. Specificially, he\nwarned that the addition of North\nAtlantic lend-lease to the currently\nprojected $15 billion in military ex\npenditures \"would contribute to the\nneed for additional taxes or to the\nmaking of a budget deficit.\"\nBEHIND THIS LANGUAGE is\nNourse's fear that the cold war is\nundermining the economic strength\nand social fabric of the country. He\nemphasized his disagreement with the\nnotion that \"the present scale of mil\nitary expenditure is really good for\nthe economy and that a few billions\nmore would be better.\"\nThe fact is that the cold war has\nheld down the necessary expansion\nof the nation's resources and limited\nits social services far below the pres\nent minimum needs of the American\npeople.

I have been on this cam\npaign some weeks. There has\nbeen nowhere else, that Is,\nwhere people have shown a\ngreater cordiality and a greater\nwelcome than here. I cannot\ntell you how deeply I feel hon\nored by your cordiality.\nThere are many reasons why\nI am happy to be here again in\nCalifornia. I shall not waste\ncompliments on natural beauty\nand natural wealth of your\ngreat State; these blessings\nspeak eloquently for themselves.\nI must, however, pay tribute\nto another and greater richness\nthat you enjoy. I am speaking\nof your richness in leadership.\nYours is the home State of\nmy running mate\u2014a young man\nwhose courage and forth\nrightedness has stirred admira\n\u2022 tion and approbation all over\nour country your Senator,\nDick Nixon. Yours is also the\nhome State of another man\nwhom I greatly admire. Gov.\nEarl Warren. Your Governor\ncombines personal and political\ngifts of a high order into a fine\nblend of common sense and hu\nmanity. Beside these two men\nstands a third to match them.\nIn the past three weeks of our\nclose association I have really\ncome to know your senior Sena\ntor and to appreciate the fine\nquality of his mind and spirit\u2014\nSenator Bill Knowland.\nSo it is not simply with re\nspect but also with gratitude\nthat I pay tribute to California\u2019s\ngreatest wealth\u2014the leaders\nchosen by its people. My fellow\nAmericans, no state or nation\ncan ask for a greater blessing\nthan leadership of Wisdom and\ncourage. With this endowment\n\u25a0 \u2014subtle but decisive, intangible\nbut indestructible\u2014free nations\nhave a strength no tyranny\ncan match.\nTonight I am going to speak\nto you about some of the ca\nlamities that have come to our\nNation because of lack of this\nkind of leadership. I am going\nto speak of ways to discover\nand display that leadership in\nthe years that lie ahead.\nPacific Is No Longer\nSure Guardian\nThere was a time when your\ngreat Pacific Coast land was\nrightly called the safest place in\nthe world. But the vast Pa\ncific Ocean is no Jftnger the sure\nguardian of yomTOiomes that it\nwas in the last century. The\nsame forces which threaten the\nEast and the North and the\nSouth are an equal danger to\nthe West. In America today we\nhave a common need for a com\nmon defense.\nJust north of where we are\ngathered tonight passes an his\ntoric line that encircles the\nglobe. This line is invisible in\nAmerica. But in another land\nIt is traced in blood. It is the\n38th parallel, the line which di\nvides North and South Korea.\nToday, this bloody line marks\nthe \u201cdefense perimeter\u201d of our\ncountry in that part of Asia.\nYet scarcely more than two\nyears ago the present admini\nstration announced its political\ndecision that the \"defense per\nimeter\u201d of America in that part\nof the world was a quite dif\nferent line. That defense line\ndid not touch Korea\u2014or indeed\nany part of the mainland of\nAsia\u2014but ran through islands\nwell off the continental shore.\nMany an American family\nknows only too well how history\nhas dealt with this policy de\ncision of our Government. The\nCommunists hastened to ex\nploit it. And we Americans are\nstill paying dearly to redeem it.\nThere has been a lot of public\ndiscussion lately about this\nmatter Perhaps intentionally\nthis has obscured the basic fact.\nThe basic fact is that this de\ncision was political in nature\u2014\na matter of high policy. The\nmaking of such a decision in\nour American scheme of gov\nernment rests exclusively with\nour civilian officials. The mili\ntary may be called upon to ad\nvise, to give counsel, to appraise\nthe strategy. But so long as we\nhave been a Nation the military\nhas never decided questions of\nforeign policy. And if we are to\ncontinue to be free, the military\nnever will.\nDid Not Foresee\nPolitical Decisions\nI remember well, of course,\nthat in 1947 the Joint Chiefs of\nStaff made a secret military ap\npraisal of the strategic impor\ntance of Korea to our armies in\nthe event of a general war in\nthe future. I was Chief of Staff\nof the Army at the time. As\nalways, the Joint Chiefs were\ncareful to refrain from political\njudgments that were beyond\ntheir authority.\nBut there were some things\nback there in 1947 that I didn\u2019t\nforesee would happen. First: I\ndidn\u2019t foresee that\u2014three years\nlater\u2014the Secretary of State\nwould translate that strictly\nmilitary appraisal fov war con\nditions into a peacetime po\nlitical decision. Second; I\nfailed to anticipate that\u2014three\nyears later\u2014the Secretary of\nState would make public' this\npolitical decision to a potential\nenemy. Third; I certainly\nfailed to foresee that\u2014five\nyears later\u2014this military as\nsessment of a possible war situ\nation would be used by a des-\nperate administration as the\nexcuse for the political decision\nwhich it took in exercise of its\ncivilian responsibilities entirely\non its own initiative.\nYes, I failed to foresee that\nthere would be such a lack of\ncourage and candor in -high\npublic office.\nLet me also set the record\nstraight on another matter.\nThe always-right-and-never\nwrong chief of the party now\nin power has made fantastic\ncharges against me, because of\nsomething I said in 1945. After\nthe war\u2019s end, I voiced an op\ntimistic hope and belief that\nthe Russian foreign policy was\nnot then hostile but was in\nfluenced by a desire for work\nable friendship with the Amer\nican people.\nThat hope\u2014shared by our\nwhole Nation was quickly\nproved to be in vain. Yet, in\nthat hope, there then seemed\nto be the last best chance for\nworld peace. Had we not striven\nfor it then, how bitterly would\nwe condemn ourselves now.\nWas Urging Maintenance\nOs U. S. Armed Strength\nThis man who recalls the\nhope that I expressed in 1945,\nconveniently forgot the circum\nstances under which I expressed\nthat hope. I was testifying at\nthe time before a congressional\ncommittee. I was then urging\nthe maintenance of American\narmed strength and the proper\ntraining of American boys\nto bear arms. My testimony\namounted to an appeal to the\nCongress to take every military\nprecaution against the day\nwhen our most optimistic hope\n\u2014mine and my fellow country\nmen\u2019s\u2014might be shattered and\ndisillusioned.\nLooking backward from 1952,\nI m mighty glad that I supported\nin 1945 a policy of hope for the\nbest and prepare for the worst.\nMy statement was made before\nthe Kremlin tipped its hand.\nBut now listen to the same\nnever-wrong man who is de\ncrying this 1945 position of\nmine. In 1948, three years \u2019ater,\nand after repeated instances of\nSoviet duplicity, the same\nnever-wrong man said \u201cI like\nold Uncle Joe Stalin. Joe is a\ndecent fellow.\u201d\nI hope you will bear with me\nfor having called history to the\nwitness stand. It\u2019s probably not\nvery important that these\ncharges against me are false.\nBut it is important for the\npeople to decide whether they\nwant to continue in power an\nadministration that will make\nsuch charges to cover its own\ntragic mistakes.\nI have spoken enough about\nthe past. Today, most Ameri\ncans agree that our defense of\nthe peace since 1945 has been\ncareless and dangerous. Now I\nwish to speak of the future.\nI first refer to Korea\u2014there\nwe are engaged in a shooting\nwar.

No one\ncan pledge you more. Nor can\nthere be a more solemn pledge.\nFor this war is reaching tonight\ninto the homes of hundreds of\nthousands of American families.\nI do not believe that Korea\nmust forever be a part of our\nAmerican daily life. The South\nKorean Ambassador has re\ncently said \u201cGive us guns; spare\nyour sons.\u201d Here one way is\npointed. I shall never say as\nthe present administration says:\nBecause the problem is tough\nthe problem can\u2019t be solved.\nToday this world dwells in a\ntwilight zone between peace\nand war\u2014a zone we call \u201ccold\n.war.\u201d What courses of action\nlie before us in shaping na\ntional policy? And here, ladies\nand gentlemen, I embark upon\na discussion of what we can do\nnow in order that we ourselves\nmay not fall prey to that most\ndread of all diseases\u2014defeatism\n\u2014and on the other hand that\nwe may not be urged toward the\ngreatest tragedy that could\novertake the modern world\u2014\nwar.\nAnd here ladies and gentle\nmen, I embark upon a discus\nsion of what we can do now in\norder that we ourselves may not\nfall prey to that most dread of\nall diseases\u2014defeatism\u2014and on\nthe other hand that we may not\nbe urged toward the greatest\ntragedy that could over take the\n| modern world\u2014war.\nOne is to appease. That is a\nproven folly.\nA second course would be to\nadopt a stupidly aggressive atti\ntude and so markedly increase\nthe risk of global war. Modern\nwar is not a conceivable choice\nin framing national policy. War\nwould do unthinkable damage\nto every moral and material\ni value we cherish.\n' War is the last desperate re\nsort when freedom itself is at\nstake.\nThe third course is to prose\ncute the \u201ccold war\u201d in which we\nnow find ourselves with vigor\nand wisdom.\nCold War Waged to\nEscape War Itself\nThe prerequisite to winning\nany victory is a single-minded\ndetermination to get the job\ndone; a single-minded dedica\ntion to that job. Without such\ndetermination and dedication\nthere can be no victory but only\na stalemate, only a road uphill\npaved with excuse and evasion.\nSo to our task we must bring\nthe quality of vigor.\nN6w let us talk about the\nwisdom and skill which we need\nto prosecute this \u201ccold war\u201d\nthat infects nations all around\nthe globe.\nRemeber this: We wage a\n\u201ccold war\u201d in order to escape\nthe horror of its opposite\u2014war\nitself.\nIn \u201ccold war\u201d we do not use\nan arsenal of arms and arma\nments. Rather, we use all means\nshort of war to lead men to\nbelieve in the values that will\npreserve peace and freedom. Our\naim in \u201ccold war\u201d is not conquest\nof territory or subjugation by\nforce. Our aim is more suotle,\nmore pervasive, more complete.\nWe are trying to get the world\nby peaceful means to believe\nthe truth. The truth is that\nAmericans want ,a world at\npeace, a world in which all\npeople shall have opportunity\nfor maximum individual devel\nopment.\nThe means we shall employ to\nspread this truth are often called\n\u201cpsychological.\u201d Don\u2019t be afraid\nof that term just because its a\nflve-dollar, five-syllable word.\n\u201cPsychological warfare\u201d is the\nstruggle for the minds and wills\nof men.\nMany people think \u201cpsycho\nlogical warfare\u201d means just the\nuse of propaganda like the con\ntroversial \u201cVoice of America.\u201d\nCertainly the use of propaganda,\nof the written and spoken word,\nof every means known to trans\nmit ideas, is an essential part of\nwinning other people to your\nside. But propaganda is not the\nmost important part in this\nstruggle. The present adminis\ntration has never yet been able\nto grasp the full import of a\npsychological effort put forth\non a national scale.\nWould Time and Direct\nActs Toward Target\nWhat would such a peacetime\nof \u201ccold war\u201d national strategy\nmean? It would mean, in the\nfirst place, the selection of broad\nnational purposes and the desig\nnation within those purposes of\nprincipal targets.\nThen it would mean this: Ev\nery significant act of Govern\nment should be so timed and so\ndirected at a principal target\nand so related to other govern\nmental actions that it will pro\nduce the maximum effect. It\nmeans that our Government in\nthis critical matter will no\nlonger be divided into airtight\ncompartments.\nIt means that In carrying out\na national policy, every depart\nment and every agency of Gov\nIPHERjMjjPUPf^ARKETS\n6205 GEORGIA AVE.

We shall\nno longer have a Department\nof State that deals with foreign\npolicy in an aloof cloister; a de\nfense establishment that makes\nmilitary appraisal in a vacuum;\na mutual Security Administra\ntion that, with sovereign inde\npendence, spends billions over\nseas. We must bring the dozens\nof agencies and bureaus into\nconcerted action under an over\nall scheme of strategy.\nAnd we must have a firm\nhand on the tiller to sail the\nship along a consistent course.\nIn past years, we have lacked\nleadership to develop such a\nstrategy. The administration in\npower has failed to bring into\nline its criss-crossing\nlapping, and jealous depart\nments and bureaus, and agen\ncies. It has failed to follow up\nthe policies made b\u00a3 the Na\ntional Security Council. Were\nthey uniformly carried out, or\nwere they carried out at all?\nToo often the answer is that no\none knows. That is why Amer\nica\u2019s great power in its exercise\nhas so often failed to get the\nmost beneficial results. The\nadministration hasn\u2019t brought\nto bear all our forces at the\nsame time under the same plan,\non the same target.\nExamples of Effective\nPolitical Warfare\nIt\u2019s time we did!\n(Editor\u2019s note: The follow\ning five paragraphs were not\ndelivered due to the lack of\nbroadcast time. However, they\nare part of the record and aides\nsaid the general will stand be\nhind the statements.)\nWhile we have been dozing at\nthe gate of the psychological,\nstrategists of Communism have\ncrept into our citadel. Let me\ncite one example of their effec\ntive political warfare.\nIn June of 1951, when we\nwere driving back the Commu\nnist forces in Korea, the free\nworld was electrified by what\nappeared to be a genuine offer\nby the Soviet to co-operate in\nreaching a peaceful solution in\nKorea. We and our allies ea\ngerly met them halfway. But\nas month after bloody month\ndragged by we came to realize\nthat we had been swindled.\nNow, a year and three months\nlater, we have learned a bitter\nlesson in \u201ccold war\u201d strategy.\nWe know now how all this time\nhas been spent by the enemy.\nThe Communist military posi\ntion has been repaired. Beyond\nthat, it has probably been made\nhalf again as strong.\nThe Soviet trap was perfectly\nconceived, perfectly timed, per\nfectly sprung. For 15 months\nnow, free world diplomacy has\nbeen trying to climb the walls\nof a bear pit into which it fell.\nThis lesson in the warfare of\nthe mind can be fully appreci\nated only by contrast with\nAmerican performances. Just\nconsider as an example the\nState Department\u2019s declaration\non our Asiatic \u201cdefense perime\nter.\u201d\nThere was psychological strat\negy in reverse By it we man\naged to worry all our friends in\nthe Far East and to encourage,\n-if not invite, the ordeal in\nKorea\nIf we are to prevail in this\n\u201ccold war\u201d struggle for the\nminds and wills of humanity,\nwe must do better. We must be\nworthy of respect and regard.\nBecause we are know abroad by\nthe character and ability of our\nNational Government, it must\nbe that one inspires world re\nspect and regard. When we,\nourselves, can take honest pride\nin our national leadership, peo\nple in other lands will wish to\nshare that pride.\nMany Peaceful Tools\nNeeded in Fight\nThere are many peaceful tools\nthat must be used in the waging\nof this fight.

Second: In spirit and\nresolve we should see in this\n\u201ccold war\u201d a * chance to gain a\nvictory without casualties, to\nwin a contest that can quite\nliterally save peace.\u201d\nThird: We must realize that\nas a Nation, everything we say,\neverything we do, and every\nthing we fail to.say or do will\nhave its impact in other lands.\nIt will affect the minds and\nwills of men and women there.\nFourth: We must choose a\nman of exceptional qualifica\ntions to handle the national\npsychological effort. He should\nhave the full confidence of, and\ndirect access to, the Chief Exec\nutive. I have suggested in other\ntalks that this function may be\nbest worked out through a re\nvitalized and reconstructed Na\ntional Security Council.\nMust Continue to Help\nFree People Stay Free\nWe must, of course, continue\nto help free people stay free.\nWe must prevent further con\nquest by the Communists that\nwould increase their strength\nand weaken us. We must also\ngive to those already enslaved,\nhope that will enable them to\ncontinue resisting the oppressor\nuntil his hold can be gradually\nweakened, and loosened from\nwithin.\nIn all these undertakings the\ndecisive fact will be the spirit,\nthe resolve, the determination\nwith which we bend to our\ntask. We are not going to win\nthe struggle for men\u2019s minds\nmerely by tripling congressional\nappropriations for super-loud\nVoice of America. Rather, it\nwill be the message which we\ngive the voice to speak. Rather,\nit will be the spiritual strength,\nthe understanding and the\ncompassion which we Ameri\ncans can summon to put into\nthat message. Rather, it will\nbe the* planned and effective\nuse of every means to appeal to\nmen and women everywhere.\nIn this enterprise which I\ndescribe we are not trying to\nremake the world in the image\nof America. We are not trying\nto force any man to our way\nif it is not his. We are not trying\nto buy peace or bring peace\nwith the sword.\nBut we are a people who are\nstrong in faith and purpose and\nmoral courage. And we have\nan appointment to keep with\nhistory.\nIf we can show to all the\npeoples of this earth by\nmeasures like those I have des\ncribed tonight that their hope\nis our hope, that their goal is\nour goal, then we shall keep\nthat appointment with history.\nAnd that appointment is the\nmost important that history has\never made for it can bring peace\non earth.\nPTA Plans Open House\nThe Parent-Teachers .

I have been grateful. But now it\nis my turn. I am momentarily bold enough\nto offer some hard advice to religious leaders\nin fact to leaders of all world faiths.\nIn briefest form, the advice is this:\nIt is time for them to de-emphasise\ntheir differences and to join in focusing\nworld attention on the remarkable\namount of agreement among the faiths\n(as opposed to the godless dogma of world\ncommunism).\nPutting it more explicitly: The world\u2019s\ngreat religions are far more unified in\ntheir belief in God, brotherhood and\ndecency than most of mankind realizes.\nSimply demonstrating and dramatizing\nthat basic unity can strengthen the con\nfidence and faith of hundreds of millions.\nFree men and believing men everywhere are\ngroping for new sources of strength, confi\ndence and hope. Meanwhile, behind the Iron\nCurtain, the depraved enemies of all religions\nare temporarily off balance. Stalin\u2019s heirs are\nhaggling, intriguing and vacillating. The time\nis here for the world\u2019s great religions to stop\nconcentrating on their differences, to spotlight\nthe clear and great principles on which all\nagree (and which the Kremlin abhors), and\nto launch a world \u201cCrusade Os All Faiths.\u201d\nThis noted layman has listened to preachings of\nreligious leaders from all over the world. Now he\nhas some advice for them: \u201cStop quarreling over\ndifferences. The beliefs you hold in common could\nhelp save the world from war and communism\u201d\nIf thc> would do so jointly and dramat\nically. they could reinvigorate the wide\nspread religious belief that tyrants have\ndesperately tried to stamp out; they could\nhelp bolster the sagging unity and deter\nmination of free men; and they could\nhelp speed the end of the nightmare\nknown as the cold war.\nAll that isn\u2019t easy and I have been as\nskeptical as any about talk of a spiritual\nawakening that will win the cold war without\nanybody having to work at it. Yet it is likely\nthat such a Crusade Os All Faiths, if drama\ntized around the world by radio, leaflets and\nother means, could have a striking impact in\nfree areas and enslaved areas alike.\nI can hear \u201cpractical\u201d objections already.\n\u201cDo you expect to accomplish miracles by\nwords alone?\u201d \u201cAre you trying to persuade\nour friends behind the Iron Curtain to revolt\nprematurely and thus get themselves killed\noff?\u201d\nThe answer is \"no\u201d in both cases. Religious\nleaders are simply urged to join forces be\nlatedly. not in achieving miracles but in help\ning to forward the cause of decency and free\ndom. History is filled with cases where people,\nunited and inspired by the right words, have\nprofoundly altered the trend of history\u2014 and\noften without bloodshed. It can happen again.\n\u201cFaith,\u201d it has been said, \u201cis a contagious\nthing.\u201d Nothing can beget faith and confi\ndence as effectively as seeing it in millions of\none\u2019s fellows around the world.\nAs practical a man as Owen D. Young gave\nsupport to the idea only a few months ago. He\nsaid: \u201cAll religious organizations everywhere\nI don't care whether they are Mohammed\nans or Buddhists or whatever who oeueve\nin an omnipotent, all-wise Creator should be\nworking together... We should stop arguing\nabout minor differences over what the next\nworld is. What we need is unification on faith\nin a great Creator, on sympathy with the\nsalvation of men in this world.\u201d\nActually, the task isn\u2019t as difficult as it\nfirst sounds:\nThe principles are clear. Ever since the\ncold war began, statesmen, thinkers and prop\nagandists of many nations have groped for\nsome sort of new and ringing \u201cCreed of the\nFree World.\u201d Yet the essence of the creed had\nbeen right under their noses. I realized this\nonly the other day while thumbing through\nvoluminous material on the religions of the\nworld. The basic creed consists of clear and\nsimple beliefs that are shared by all of the\nworld\u2019s great religions: The dignity of the\nindividual; the brotherhood of man; the Golden\nRule; the fatherhood of God.\nTW 1-I*-S4", "batch": "dlc_edgar_ver01", "title_normal": "evening star.", "url": "https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1954-01-10/ed-1/seq-115.json", "place": ["District of Columbia--Washington"], "page": "10"}, {"sequence": 2, "county": ["Holmes"], "edition": null, "frequency": "Weekly", "id": "/lccn/sn87065228/1951-03-08/ed-1/seq-2/", "subject": ["Durant (Miss.)--Newspapers.", "Mississippi--Durant.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01231317"], "city": ["Durant"], "date": "19510308", "title": "The Durant news.", "end_year": 1985, "note": ["Archived issues are available in digital format from the Library of Congress Chronicling America online collection.", "Description based on: Vol. 16, no. 27 (Mar. 17, 1899).", "Editor: Hazel Brannon Smith (1936-1985)."], "state": ["Mississippi"], "section_label": "", "type": "page", "place_of_publication": "Durant, Miss.", "start_year": 1882, "edition_label": "", "publisher": "John Kyllingstad & M.J.

For our production workers we need (1) better\ntools and (2) more tools so that a man can produce more on\nhis job. Then we need (3) better trained workers and (4) more\nskillful management to cut waste, step up efficiency. Finally\nwe need (5) to find ways to make jobs more interesting.\nThe end point of all five is higher production per man.\nIf we make more waffle irons, coupes and sun lamps at steadily\nlower costs, more people can use and enjoy these things.\nBut what about depressions? Won\u2019t they throw everything\noff? They have not done so in the past. Since 1900 we have\nhad several small and medium-sized depressions, and one\nwhopper. Yet real wages have gone up, on the average, about\n2 Yi per cent per year. And CED feels that with controls we\nhave now developed and lessons we have now learned, we are\nin a position to soften the effects of a major slump.\nT)f course, there is an argument against high productivity.\nIt goes like this: if a man can do more work, then fewer men\nare needed. And all you get is unemployment.\nActually high productivity in America has seldom had that\nresult except temporarily. Our high productivity has worked\nas a two-way lever pushing prices down and wages up. It has\nalso kept the economy expanding with new jobs opening up.\nBecause this has been our experience, some people expect\nour standard of living to keep right on climbing, no matter\nwhat. It always has, why should it stop now?\nIt shouldn\u2019t, except that 1950 is quite different from any\nof the prewar years.

As far as the standard of living is concerned, the work\nof these people is wasted,\n\u2022 Our population is getting older. A bigger portion of our\npeople each year drop out of the work force because of age.\nThis group, steadily increasing, must be supported by the\nproductive work of others.\nOf course, we can\u2019t do anything about our past birth rate,\nnor can we stop the cold war overnight. But these new 1950\nconditions make it all the more important that we boost the\nproductivity of those who do make the useful things which\nmeasure our standard of living.\nThe Committee for Economic Development has blocked\nout 10 suggestions which it thinks will keep our production\nrate climbing, cold war or not.

FOR YEARS A\nRUSSIAN APOLOGIST, HE NOW TELLS\n\u201cWHERE I\nWAS WRONG\u201d\nby Henry A. Wallace\nMany people have asked me how I recon\ncile my stand before Korea with my\nuncompromising anti-Communist attitude of\nthe past two years. The answer is simple.\nBefore 1949 I thought Russia really wanted\nand needed peace. After 19491 became more\nand more disgusted with the Soviet methods\nand finally became convinced that the Polit\nburo wanted the Cold War continued indefi\nnitely, even at the peril of accidentally pro\nvoking a hot war.\nIn this article I shall speak frankly of some\nof the circumstances which have caused me to\nrevise my attitude.\nItipifti Flaws Cssilnil\u00dfvslris\nAmong the first were the shocking revela\ntions of the activities of Russia\u2019s atomic spies. j\nThis plus the testimony of American ex-Com\nmunists convinced me that Russia had been\ngetting information illegally to which neither j\nshe nor any other nation was entitled.\nNext, I was deeply moved by reports of\nfriends who had visited Czechoslovakia short-\nly after the Communists took control. In the\nsummer of 1949, a member of the Progressive\nParty visited Czechoslovakia and reported\nthe dispossession of relatives whose only crime\nwas to own a small business. No one, I was\ntold, could amount to anything who was not\nan outspoken critic of the U.S. and capitalism.\n1944 RMSSHMI TO CHIM: WaH^T\"\nand governor of Szechwan Province\nA*.A \\\n\u2018 M -r\n\u25a0 I J\n-:, v , - *\u2022' * I\nm* \u25a0 C\"~- \u2022\n\\ Jm 'W MmBWWB:\n\u2022 BV MJ3\nK '%&f v \u2019T'\n%' > Spw. IS\n_.*i\u00bb r% BbBHbII IMj,\nWALLACE says big mistake was not denouncing Red coup in Czechoslovakia\nOnly Moscow-trained Communists were\nallowed in positions of authority.\nAs I look back over the past 10 years I now\nfed that my greatest mistake was in not de\nnouncing the Communist take-over of Czecho\nslovakia in February of 1948.\nAt that time I labored under the illusion\nthat the Communists bad beaten us to the\npunch in popular appeal, and that they had\nthe support of most of the people, who feared\na resurgent Germany more than a domineer\ning Russia. Therefore I said democratic\nCzechoslovakia was a victim of the Cold War.\nHer hatred and fear of the Germans had\nthrown her into the arms of Russia and placed\nfirst Benes and Masaryk and finally the\nCzech-born Communists in an impossible\nposition.\nIn other words I blamed the Communist\ncoup in Czechoslovakia partly on geography\nand partly on history.\nUp to a point, my analysis was sound, but\nit foiled utterly to take into account the ruth\nless nature of Russian-trained Communists\nwhose sole objective was to make Czecho\nslovakia completely subservient to Moscow.\nTime has also brought me new understanding\nof the Korean question. In 19481 believed both\nRussia and the U.S. should take their troops\nout of Korea.\nToday, knowing more about Russia\u2019s\nmethods, I am sine it was a serious mistake\nwhen we withdrew our troops. Russia may\nnot want a hot war at any time in the next\n10 years but she certainly wants such a\ncontinuation of the Cdd War as will enable\nher, through her satellites and internally\nplanted subversives, to take over the greatest\namount of territory possible. Russia is still on\nthe march and the question now is whether she\nwill be able to take over all of Asia, including\nIndia and the Near East.\nTurning .back to World War 11, it is\nnecessary to mention the period in 1944 when\nI went across Soviet Asia to China on a war-\nContinued on page 29\n7", "batch": "dlc_borisgodunov_ver01", "title_normal": "evening star.", "url": "https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1952-09-07/ed-1/seq-122.json", "place": ["District of Columbia--Washington"], "page": "7"}, {"sequence": 6, "county": ["Nome"], "edition": null, "frequency": "Weekly (except last week in December)", "id": "/lccn/sn84020662/1960-07-13/ed-1/seq-6/", "subject": ["Alaska--Nome.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01217568", "Nome (Alaska)--Newspapers."], "city": ["Nome"], "date": "19600713", "title": "The Nome nugget.

Mikoyan talked com*\nmon sense when he point\ned out how utterly absurd it*\nis to continue the cold war,\nwhen it is possible to main*\ntain good neighborly relations\nby peaceful coexistence and\npeaceful competition.\nWhen a Ford worker said h\u015f.\nwas a \u201cregular guy like us/'\nhe voiced the feeling of mil\nlions of Americans. How many\nAmericans who visited the So\nviet Union did not say the\nsame thing about the people\nthey met in the Soviet Union!\nThe Soviet leader justly\npraised the achievements of\nour people, the relative high\nstandard of living, the modern\nbuilding sites, the modern\nhomes and roads. But he also\ntold the American people\nwhat often is not being told\nto them: \u201cThere was no war on\nyour territory; there was no\nlarge-scale destruction inflict\ned by war, such as was suffer*\ned by the Soviet Union; and\nthe last war did not know\nsuch devastating weapons as\nthere are nowadays. But let\nus hope\u2014and those, who be\nlieve in God, pray\u2014that there\nwill not be another war and\nthat neither your country nor\nours, nor any other country\nneed ever suffer from war\u201d.\nWe are sure it is the kind\nof language and the thoughts\nbehind it that our people will\nunderstand and appreciate.\n\u2605 \u2605 \u2605\nMR. MIKOYAN came to renew\nold acquaintances and make\nnew contacts, to see what\nwas new, and to do what he\ncould to bring about better re\nlations between our two coun\ntries. It\u2019s that simple, if you don\u2019t\ntry to befuddle the issue, if you\nalso seek the same objectives.\n\u201cThe American people we met\ndaring oar trip,\u201d said Mr. Mikoyan\nat the National Press Club lunch\neon given in his honor, \u201chave\nbeen just as friendly as they\nwere before. Your people are\nvery much like our Soviet people,\nfor ours are as simple, hospita\nble and sociable as yours. Our peo\nple are brought up in the spirit\nof peace and friendship, oppos\ning war. Here in this country, the\npeople are strongly influenced by\nthe 'cold war/ but I am glad to\nsay that those Americans whom\nI met want peace. I was partic\nularly pleased to find this but\nwas not surprised, for I knew all\nalong that this is the attitude\nof the people\u201d.\nThese are some general ideas\none gathers from Mr. Mikoyan\u2019s\nvisit. We are convinced his trip\nto the United States did a lot of\ngood. We believe more contacts,\nare needed. We must not allow\nthe politicians to decide whether\nto continue the cold war or to\nabandon such a destructive and\nunworthy policy. The American\npeople have it in their power to\nassert themselves so that the cold\nwar may be replaced by warm 4\nfriendship and exchanges between\nour two peoples who fought side\nby side against the Nazi hordes.\nAll in all Mr. Mikoyan proved\nonce more that peaceful coexis\ntence is not only desirable and\npossible, but necessary.", "batch": "mimtptc_fostoria_ver01", "title_normal": "roma\u0302nul american.", "url": "https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045399/1959-01-31/ed-1/seq-4.json", "place": ["Michigan--Wayne--Detroit"], "ocr_rum": "Pagina 8\nEx-Presedintele Truman Ar Face Mai Bine Sa Tac\u0103\nf\nTrebuie s\u0103 admitem c\u0103 fos\ntul pre\u015fedinte Truman profit\u0103\nmai bine \u015fi mai mult din faptul\nc\u0103 a fost odat\u0103 pre\u015fedinte al\nStatelor Unite, dec\u00eet de faptul\nc\u0103 a fost odat\u0103 negustor de\nconfec\u0163ii (haine, c\u0103me\u015fi etc.).\nAstfel se aptic\u0103 \u015fi scrie arti\ncole lungi, care nu pot fi ci\ntate dec\u00eet cu permisiunea d\nsale, pentru care prime\u015fte re\nmunera\u0163ii generoase.

Mikoy\nan has returned to his country\non the eve of the twenty-first\nCongress of the Soviet Com\nmunist Party.\nHis visit to the United States\ncreated tremendous interest\nand occasioned many com\nments on the part of our press\nand many distinguished per\nsonalities, \u2014and some not so\ndistinguished. But above all,\nMr. Mikoyan\u2019s visit stirred the\nAmerican people.\nThe Observer followed with\ngreat interest Mr. Mikoyan\u2019s\ntravels, his utterances, his con\nduct, and the reaction of those\nwith whom he came in con\ntact. The comments of some\n\u2018wise-guys\u2019 were pitiful where\nas the comments of those who\nare interested in peace and a\nrapprochement with the So\nviet Union, were responsible,\nreasonable and in the true\nAmerican tradition of cordial\nity.\nThere is no need in repeat\ning the praise of Mr. Mikoy\nan\u2019s personality, his wit, his\nsparkling intelligence, as Pres\nident Eisenhower also recog\nnized, his warmth as well as\nhis dignity as the representa\ntive of the First World Social\nist land.\n\u2605 \u2605 \u2605\nWE won\u2019t bother with Mr.\nLawrence Spivak\u2019s rude\nness toward this distinguished\nvisitor. Mr. Crosby, the TV\ncritic of the New York Herald\nTribune, did a good job, and\nwe are inclined to agree with\nhim when he said that Spivak\nmade \u201can ass of himself\u201d dur\ning the one hour TV interview\non the Meet The Press pro\ngram of which he is the pro\nducer.\nWe believe the Sunday\n(Jan. 25) New York Times\n(The News of the Week in Re\nview) , sounded rather sour\nwhen it insisted that the rea\nson for Mr. Mikoyan\u2019s visit\nremains a \u201cperplexity.\u201d Natu\nrally, for those who are for\never prone to suspect and to\nperpetuate suspicion concern\ning the Soviet Union, the So\nviet leader\u2019s visit remains a\n\u201cperplexity.\u201d But, we venture\nto say, for the average Ameri\ncan Mr. Mikoyan\u2019s visit, his\ncontacts with all kinds of peo\nple, his utterances without ifs\nand buts, was an eye opener:\nThe American people must\nhave belatedtly realized how\nthey were taken for a ride\nby the anti-Soviet propagand\nists, by the architects of the\ncold war and brinkmanship.\nThey came face to face\nwith one of the outstanding\nleaders of the Socialist world\nand they realized that they\nwere dealing with a warm hu\nman being, who extended a\nwarm and fraternal hand to\nthe American people. They\nmust have realized that for\nyears they have been told so\nmany lies and untruths about\nthat country and its people.\nOf course, the American\npeople whatever their poli\ntical convictions came face\nto face with a representative\nof anew system of society who\nS\u00eemb&t\u0103, 31 ianuarie 195 y", "page": "Pagina 8"}, {"sequence": 1, "county": [null], "edition": null, "frequency": "Daily", "id": "/lccn/sn83045462/1963-07-26/ed-1/seq-1/", "subject": ["Washington (D.C.)--fast--(OCoLC)fst01204505", "Washington (D.C.)--Newspapers."], "city": ["Washington"], "date": "19630726", "title": "Evening star.

Nor do\nthey believe United States counter\nmoves were responsible for the end\nof the offensive, but they think they\nhelped.\nIn reviewing the last few years of\nRussian-United States relations\nthat led to the Initialing of the test\nban treaty yesterday in Moscow, ad\nministration officials think the\nKremlin was forced to end its of\nfensive far short of its early opti\nmistic goals.\nAnd although they credit their\nown policies for much of this, they\ngive even more credit to the in\nexorable pressures of economics,\npolitics, the cost of the arms race,\nnationalism and a heart attack in\nthe Kremlin hierarchy.\nSomewhat surprisingly, perhaps,\nRussia\u2019s split with Red China is\nconsidered a relatively minor factor.\nAnd the intricate and prolonged\nnegotiations over a test ban are\nthought to have had the least bear\ning on the outcome.\nNumerous officials were asked\nwhat went into yesterday\u2019s settle\nment. This is an account of what\nthey said about the cold war events\nthat preceded the treaty, the in\nternal problems that plague Russia\nand the outlook for future world\nsecurity.\nA Key Date\nHistorians will trace the course of\nthe most recent Russian cold war\noffensive from the first Sputnik,\nthrough the gains and losses of\nLaos, Viet Nam, Guinea, the Congo,\nBerlin, Cuba and finally, the test\nban.\nBut administration leaders say\nthe key date is May 3, 1961, less\nthan four months after President\nKennedy took office. On that day,\nMr. Kennedy paused in a purpose\nful stride toward war In Laos.\nThe new President had ordered a\nmilitary showdown with Russia,\nkept secret from the public until to\nday, to show the Kremlin that this\ncountry was ready and willing to\nfight for its vital interests.\nThe threat of war did these\nthings, officials say:\nIt produced a cease fire in Laos\non May 3, and a compronihy settle\nment at Geneva two weeks later\nthat permitted the United States\nto disband a massive invasion force.\nBut also\u2014and this goes directly\nto yesterday\u2019s test ban agreement\u2014\nit gave the Russians direct evidence\nthat their latest cold war offensive\nhad to slow down or lead to a nu\nclear war. It gave administration\nplanners confidence they were on\nthe right track in combating com\nmunism.\n3 Points Made.\nThe new administration\u2019s broad\nprogram was designed to take ad\nvantage of natural forces that were\nworking to steer Russia away from a\npolicy based on aggression. It tried\nto show Russian leaders that:\n1. They would not be permitted to\n<Llic Biening Blat\nV J V WITH SUNDAY MORNING EDITION <_/\nPhone LI. 3-5000\nhave a great enough military ad\nvantage over the United States to\nmake a military settlement of a\nproblem reasonable.\n2. They would not be permitted to\nhave their own way in underdevel\noped nations.\n3. It is in Russia\u2019s own interest to\naccept peaceful offers made by the\nUnited States as an alternative to\nan arms race or surrender.\nThe Laotian confrontation helped\ndemonstrate the three points to the\nRussians.\nAs long as the West continues to\ndemonstrate them, officials believe,\nRussia should continue to find it\nin its Interest to temper further cold\nwar offensives.\nThe limited test ban treaty is con\nsidered a reasonably happy end to\nthis round of the cold war, but ad\nministration Insiders are not ready\nto predict that there will not be\nother rough rounds.\n1945, Round 1\nRound one began in 1945 with the\nend of World War 11. Stalin was\ntoo tempted by a prostrate Europe\nand a demobilized America to pay\nattention to allied overtures for\nfriendship.\nThe round ended in 1947 when\nthe United States started to coun\nter Moscow\u2019s pressure with the Mar\nshall Plan, Gregk-Turkish aid, NATO,\nthe Berlin airlift and, finally, the\ndefense of Korea in 1950.\nWestern resistance showed Russia\nthat the United States would defend\nthe free world and that Europe could\nbe revived economically, psycholog\nically and politically.\nThe cold'war bumped along un\nevenly until about 1957.\nThen came Round Two.\nAs the new leadership of Russia,\nin the person of Nikita Khrushchev,\nconsolidated its power, Mr. Khru\nshchev saw a rosy Red future: He\nhad a headstart over the United\nStates in long-range ballistic mis\nsiles; he had mid-range missiles to\ntrain on Europe; he had Sputniks, a\nspectacular symbol of what he\nthought was a new balance of\npower.\nSo Russia began a double-bar\nrelled effort to get communism\nmoving again.\nRussia Tries Blackmail\nFirst, she tried blackmail. NATO\ncountries were threatened with a\nhail of missiles if they did not drop\ntheir defenses; Berlin was de\nmanded on a silver platter; and the\nIslands in the Formosa Straits were\nshelled. Mr. Khrushchev strutted\nabout the world, telling the capi\ntalists their burial was about to\nbegin.\nSecond, Russia tried to move in\nunderdeveloped countries. The\nKremlin apparently believed, quite\nsincerely, that most of Africa, Asia\nand Latin America would prefer the\nCommunist path to prosperity, even)\nif given a free choice.\nThere were some successes: The\nfighting in Laos and the Congo,\ntrouble in Guinea, the Castro revo\nlution in Cuba, Red ties with Egypt\nand trouble between Indonesia and\nthe Netherlands.\nThere also were setbacks\u2014Ameri\ncan forces Intervened to protect\nQuemoy and Matsu in the Formosa\nStraits and troops landed in Lebanon.\nBut by January, 1961, when Presi\ndent Kennedy took office, the Rus\nsian offensive was moving forward.\nThe new President and his advisers\nwent to work.\nThey Increased the military budget\nby several billion dollars, primarily\nfor long-range thermonuclear weap-\nSee TEST BAN, Page A-8\n*** B WASHINGTON, D.

       "' Persecution of heresy — The Schism of the Donatists — The Arian Controversy — Athanasius — Distracted state of the Church and the Empire under Constantine and his sons — Toleration of Paganism \\n THE grateful applause of the clergy has consecrated the memory of a prince, who indulged their passions and promoted their interest. Constantine gave them security, wealth, honours, and revenge; and the support of the orthodox faith  was considered as the most sacred and important duty of the civil magistrate. The edict of Milan, the great charter of toleration, had confirmed to each individual of the Roman world the privilege of choosing and professing his own religion. But this inestimable privilege was soon violated: with the knowledge of truth the emperor imbibed the maxims of persecution; and the sects which dissented from the Catholic church were afflicted and oppressed by the triumph of Christianity. Constantine easily believed that the heretics, who presumed to dispute his opinions or to oppose his commands, were guilty of the most absurd and criminal obstinacy; and that a seasonable application of moderate severities might save those unhappy men from the danger of an everlasting condemnation. Not a moment was lost in excluding the ministers and teachers of the separated congregations from any share of the rewards and immunities which the emperor had so liberally bestowed on the orthodox clergy. But as the sectaries might still exist under the cloud of royal disgrace, the conquest of the East was immediately followed by an edict which announced their total destruction.(1) After a preamble filled with passion and  reproach, Constantine absolutely prohibits the assemblies of the heretics, and confiscates their public property to the use either of the revenue or of the Catholic church. The sects against whom the Imperial severity was directed appear to have been the adherents of Paul of Samosata; the Montanists of Phrygia, who maintained an enthusiastic succession of prophecy; the Novatians, who sternly rejected the temporal efficacy of repentance; the Marcionites and Valentinians, under whose leading banners the various Gnostics of Asia and Egypt had insensibly rallied; and perhaps the Manichaeans, who had recently imported from Persia a more artful composition of Oriental and Christian theology.(2) The design of extirpating the name, or at least  of restraining the progress, of these odious heretics, was prosecuted with vigour and effect. Some of the penal regulations were copied from the edicts of Diocletian; and this method of conversion was applauded by the same bishops who had felt the hand of oppression, and had pleaded for the rights of humanity. Two immaterial circumstances may serve, however, to prove that the mind of Constantine was not entirely corrupted by the spirit of zeal and bigotry. Before he condemned the Manichaeans and their kindred sects, he resolved to make an accurate inquiry into the nature of their religious principles. As if he distrusted the impartiality of his ecclesiastical counsellors, this delicate commission was intrusted to a civil magistrate, whose learning and moderation he justly esteemed, and of whose venal character he was probably ignorant. (3) The emperor was soon convinced that he had too hastily proscribed the orthodox faith and the exemplary morals of the Novatians, who had dissented from the church in some articles of discipline which were not perhaps essential to salvation. By a particular edict he exempted them from the general penalties of the law; (4) allowed them to build a  church at Constantinople; respected the miracles of their saints; invited their bishop, Acesius, to the council of Nice; and gently ridiculed the narrow tenets of his sect by a familiar jest, which from the mouth of a sovereign must have been received with applause and gratitude.(5)\\n African Controversy, A.D. 312. \\n The complaints and mutual accusations which assailed the\\n throne of Constantine, as soon as the death of Maxentius had\\n submitted Africa to his victorious arms, were ill adapted to\\n edify an imperfect proselyte. He learned with surprise that\\n the provinces of that great country, from the confines of\\n Cyrene to the Columns of Hercules, were distracted with\\n religious discord.(6) The source of the division was derived \\n from a double election in the church of Carthage, the second\\n in rank and opulence of the ecclesiastical thrones of the\\n West Caecilian and Majourinus were the two rival primates of\\n Africa; and the death of the latter soon made room for\\n Donatus, who, by his superior abilities and apparent\\n virtues, was the firmest support of his party. The advantage\\n which Cacilian might claim from the priority of his\\n ordination was destroyed by the illegal, or at least\\n indecent, haste with which it had been performed, without\\n expecting the arrival of the bishops of Numidia. The\\n authority of these bishops, who, to the number of seventy,\\n condemned Caecilian, and consecrated Majorinus, is again\\n weakened by the infamy of some of their personal characters;\\n and by the female intrigues, sacrilegious bargains, and\\n tumultuous proceedings, which are imputed to this Numidian\\n council. (7) The bishops of the contending factions \\n maintained, with equal ardour and obstinacy, that their\\n adversaries were degraded, or at least dishonoured, by the\\n odious crime of delivering the Holy Scriptures to the\\n officers of Diocletian. From their mutual reproaches, as\\n well as from the story of this dark transaction, it may\\n justly be inferred that the late persecution had embittered\\n the zeal, without reforming the manners, of the African\\n Christians. That divided church was incapable of affording\\n an impartial judicature; the controversy was solemnly tried\\n in five successive tribunals, which were appointed by the\\n emperor; and the whole proceeding, from the first appeal to\\n the final sentence, lasted above three years. A severe\\n inquisition, which was taken by the praetorian vicar and the\\n proconsul of Africa, the report of two episcopal visitors\\n who had been sent to Carthage, the decrees of the councils\\n of Rome and of Arles, and the supreme judgment of\\n Constantine himself in his sacred consistories were all\\n favourable to the cause of Caecilian; and he was unanimously\\n acknowledged by the civil and ecclesiastical powers as the\\n true and lawful primate of Africa. The honours and estates\\n of the church were attributed to his suffragan bishops, and\\n it was not without difficulty that Constantine was satisfied\\n with inflicting the punishment of exile on the principal\\n leaders of the Donatist faction. As their cause was examined\\n with attention, perhaps it was determined with justice.\\n Perhaps their complaint was not without foundation, that the\\n credulity of the emperor had been abused by the insidious\\n arts of his favourite Osius. The influence of falsehood and\\n corruption might procure the condemnation of the innocent,\\n or aggravate the sentence of the guilty. Such an act,\\n however, of injustice, if it concluded an importunate\\n dispute, might be numbered among the transient evils of a\\n despotic administration, which are neither felt nor\\n remembered by posterity.\\n \\n Schism of the Donatists, A.D. 315. \\n But this incident, so inconsiderable that it scarcely\\n deserves a place in history, was productive of a memorable\\n schism, which afflicted the provinces of Africa above three\\n hundred years, and was extinguished only with Christianity\\n itself. The inflexible zeal of freedom and fanaticism\\n animated the Donatists to refuse obedience to the usurpers,\\n whose election they disputed, and whose spiritual powers\\n they denied. Excluded from the civil and religious communion\\n of mankind, they boldly excommunicated the rest of mankind\\n who had embraced the impious party of Caecilian, and of the\\n Traditors, from whom he derived his pretended ordination.\\n They asserted with confidence, and almost with exultation,\\n that the Apostolical succession was interrupted; that all\\n the bishops of Europe and Asia were infected by the\\n contagion of guilt and schism; and that the prerogatives of\\n the catholic church were confined to the chosen portion of\\n the African believers, who alone had preserved inviolate the\\n integrity of their faith and discipline. This rigid theory\\n was supported by the most uncharitable conduct. Whenever\\n they acquired a proselyte, even from the distant provinces\\n of the East, they carefully repeated the sacred rites of\\n baptism(8) and ordination; as they rejected the validity of those which he had already received from the hands of\\n heretics or schismatics. Bishops, virgins, and even spotless\\n infants, were subjected to the disgrace of a public penance\\n before they could be admitted to the communion of the\\n Donatists. If they obtained possession of a church which had\\n been used by their Catholic adversaries, they purified the\\n unhallowed building with the same jealous care which a\\n temple of idols might have required. They washed the\\n pavement, scraped the walls, burnt the altar (which was\\n commonly of wood), melted the consecrated plate, and cast\\n the Holy Eucharist to the dogs, with every circumstance of\\n ignominy which could provoke and perpetuate the animosity of\\n religious factions.(9) Notwithstanding this irreconcilable \\n aversion, the two parties, who were mixed and separated in\\n all the cities of Africa, had the same language and manners,\\n the same zeal and learning, the same faith and worship.\\n Proscribed by the civil and ecclesiastical powers of the\\n empire, the Donatists still maintained in some provinces,\\n particularly in Numidia, their superior numbers; and four\\n hundred bishops acknowledged the jurisdiction of their\\n primate. But the invincible spirit of the sect sometimes\\n preyed on its own vitals: and the bosom of their\\n schismatical church was torn by intestine divisions. A\\n fourth part of the Donatist bishops followed the independent\\n standard of the Maximianists. The narrow and solitary path\\n which their first leaders had marked out continued to\\n deviate from the great society of mankind Even the\\n imperceptible sect of the Rogatians could affirm, without a\\n blush, that when Christ should descend to judge the earth,\\n he would find his true religion preserved only in a few\\n nameless villages of the Caesarean Mauritania.(10)\\n The Trinitarian controversy. \\n The schism of the Donatists was confined to Africa; the more\\n diffusive mischief of the Trinitarian controversy\\n successively penetrated into every part of the Christian\\n world. The former was an accidental quarrel, occasioned by\\n the abuse of freedom; the latter was a high and mysterious\\n argument, derived from the abuse of philosophy. From the age\\n of Constantine to that of Clovis and Theodoric, the temporal\\n interests both of the Romans and barbarians were deeply\\n involved in the theological disputes of Arianism. The\\n historian may therefore be permitted respectfully to\\n withdraw the veil of the sanctuary, and to deduce the\\n progress of reason and faith, of error and passion, from the\\n school of Plato to the decline and fall of the empire.\\n \\n The system of Plato. Before Christ 360. \\n The genius of Plato, informed by his own meditation or by\\n the traditional knowledge of :he priests of Egypt,(11) had \\n ventured to explore the mysterious nature of the Deity. When\\n he had elevated his mind to the sublime contemplation of the\\n first self-existent, necessary cause of the universe, the\\n Athenian sage was incapable of conceiving how the simple\\n unity of his essence could admit the infinite variety of\\n distinct and successive ideas which compose the model of the\\n intellectual world; how a Being purely incorporeal could\\n execute that perfect model, and mould with a plastic hand\\n the rude and independent chaos. The vain hope of extricating\\n himself from these difficulties, which must ever oppress the\\n feeble powers of the human mind, might induce Plato to\\n consider the divine nature under the threefold modification\\n — of the first cause, the reason, or The Logos Logos, and the soul\\n or spirit of the universe. His poetical imagination\\n sometimes fixed and animated these metaphysical\\n abstractions; the three archical or original principles\\n were represented in the Platonic system as three Gods,\\n united with each other by a mysterious and ineffable\\n generation; and the Logos was particularly considered under\\n the more accessible character of the Son of an Eternal\\n Father, and the Creator and Governor of he world. Such\\n appear to have been the secret doctrines which were\\n cautiously whispered in the gardens of the Academy; and\\n which, according to the more recent disciples of Plato,\\n could not be perfectly understood till after an assiduous\\n study of thirty years.(12)\\n taught in the scool of Alexandria. Before Christ 300. \\nThe arms of the Macedonians diffused over Asia and Egypt the\\n language and learning of Greece; and the theological system\\n of Plato was taught, with less reserve, and perhaps with\\n some improvements, in the celebrated school of Alexandria.\\n (13) A numerous colony of Jews had been invited, by the favour \\n of the Ptolemies, to settle in their new capital.(14) While \\n the bulk of the nation practised the legal ceremonies, and\\n pursued the lucrative occupations of commerce, a few Hebrews\\n of a more liberal spirit devoted their lives to religious\\n and philosophical contemplation. (15) They cultivated with \\n diligence, and embraced with ardour, the theological system\\n of the Athenian sage. But their national pride would have\\n been mortified by a fair confession of their former poverty:\\n and they boldly marked, as the sacred inheritance of their\\n ancestors, the gold and jewels which they had so lately\\n stolen from their Egyptian masters. One hundred years before\\n the birth of Christ, a philosophical treatise, which\\n manifestly betrays the style and sentiments of the school of\\n Plato, was produced by the Alexandrian Jews, and unanimously\\n received as a genuine and valuable relic of the inspired\\n Wisdom of Solomon. (16) A similar union of the Mosaic faith \\n and the Grecian philosophy distinguishes the works of Philo,\\n which were composed, for the most part, under the reign of\\n Augustus.(17) The material soul of the universe(18) might \\n offend the piety of the Hebrews; but they applied the\\n character of the Logos to the Jehovah of Moses and the\\n Patriarchs; and the Son of God was introduced upon earth,\\n under a visible and even human appearance, to perform those\\n familiar offices which seem incompatible with the nature and\\n attributes of the Universal Cause.(19)\\n Revealed by the Apostle St John, A.D. 97. \\nThe eloquence of Plato, the name of Solomon, the authority\\n of the school of Alexandria, and the consent of the Jews and\\n Greeks, were insufficient to establish the truth of a\\n mysterious doctrine, which might please, but could not\\n satisfy, a rational mind. A prophet, or apostle, inspired by\\n the Deity, can alone exercise a lawful dominion over the\\n faith of mankind: and the theology of Plato might have been\\n for ever confounded with the philosophical visions of the\\n Academy, the Porch, and the Lyccum, if the name and divine\\n attributes of the Logos had not been confirmed by the\\n celestial pen of the last and most sublime of the\\n Evangelists. (20) The Christian Revelation, which was \\n consummated under the reign of Nerva, disclosed to the world\\n the amazing secret, that the LOGOS, who was with God from\\n the beginning, and was God, who had made all things, and for\\n whom all things had been made, was incarnate in the person\\n of Jesus of Nazareth; who had been born of a virgin, and\\n suffered death on the cross. Besides the general design of\\n fixing on a perpetual basis the divine honours of Christ,\\n the most ancient and respectable of the ecclesiastical\\n writers have ascribed to the evangelic theologian a\\n particular intention to confute two opposite heresies, which\\n disturbed the peace of the primitive church.(21)\\nThe Ebionites and Docetes\\nI. The faith of the Ebionites, (22) perhaps of the Nazarenes,(23) was gross \\n and imperfect. They revered Jesus as the greatest of the\\n prophets, endowed with supernatural virtue and power. They\\n ascribed to his person and to his future reign all the\\n predictions of the Hewbrew oracles which relate to the\\n spiritual and everlasting kingdom of the promised Messiah.\\n (24) Some of them might confess that he was born of a virgin; \\n but they obstinately rejected the preceding existence and\\n divine perfections of the logos, or Son of God, which are so\\n clearly defined in the Gospel of St. John. About fifty years\\n afterwards, the Ebionites, whose errors are mentioned by\\n Justin Martyr, with less severity than they seem to deserve,\\n (25) formed a very inconsiderable portion of the Christian \\n name. II. The Gnostics, who were distinguished by the\\n epithet of Docetes, deviated into the contrary extreme, and\\n betrayed the human, while they asserted the divine nature of\\n Christ. Educated in the school of Plato, accustomed to the\\n sublime idea of the Logos, they readily conceived that the\\n brightest Aeon, or Emanation of the Deity, might assume the\\n outward shape and visible appearances of a mortal;(26) but \\n they vainly pretended that the imperfections of matter are\\n incompatible with the purity of a celestial substance. While\\n the blood of Christ yet smoked on Mount Calvary, the Docetes\\n invented the impious and extravagant hypothesis, that,\\n instead of issuing from the womb of the Virgin,(27) he had \\n descended on the banks of the Jordan in the form of perfect\\n manhood; that he had imposed on the senses of his enemies\\n and of his disciples; and that the ministers of Pilate had\\n wasted their impotent rage on an airy phantom, who seemed to\\n expire on the cross, and, after three days, to rise from the\\n dead.(28)\\n Mysterious nature of the Trinity. \\n The divine sanction which the Apostle had bestowed on the\\n fundamental principle of the theology of Plato encouraged\\n the learned proselytes of the second and third centuries to\\n admire and study the writings of the Athenian sage, who had\\n thus marvellously anticipated one of the most surprising\\n discoveries of the Christian revelation. The respectable\\n name of Plato was used by the orthodox,(29) and abused by the \\n heretics,(30) as the common support of truth and error: the \\n authority of his skilful commentators and the science of\\n dialectics were employed to justify the remote consequences\\n of his opinions, and to supply the discreet silence of the\\n inspired writers. The same subtle and profound questions\\n concerning the nature, the generation, the distinction, and\\n the equality of the three divine persons of the mysterious\\n Triad, or Trinity,(31) were agitated in the philosophical and in the Christian schools of Alexandria. An eager spirit of\\n curiosity urged them to explore the secrets of the abyss;\\n and the pride of the professors and of their disciples was\\n satisfied with the science of words. But the most sagacious\\n of the Christian theologians, the great Athanasius himself,\\n has candidly confessed (32) that, whenever he forced his \\n understanding to meditate on the divinity of the Logos, his\\n toilsome and unavailing efforts recoiled on themselves; that\\n the more he thought, the less he comprehended; and the more\\n he wrote, the less capable was he of expressing his\\n thoughts. In every step of the inquiry we are compelled to\\n feel and acknowledge the immeasurable disproportion between\\n the size of the object and the capacity of the human mind.\\n We may strive to abstract the notions of time, of space, and\\n of matter, which so closely adhere to all the perceptions of\\n our experimental knowledge. But as soon as we presume to\\n reason of infinite substance, of spiritual generation, as\\n often as we deduce any positive conclusions from a negative\\n idea, we are involved in darkness, perplexity, and\\n inevitable contradiction. As these difficulties arise from\\n the nature of the subject, they oppress, with the same\\n insuperable weight, the philosophic and the theological\\n disputant; but we may observe two essential and peculiar\\n circumstances which discriminated the doctrines of the\\n catholic church from the opinions of the Platonic school.\\n \\n Zeal of the Christians.\\nI. A chosen society of philosophers, men of a liberal\\n education and curious disposition, might silently meditate,\\n and temperately discuss in the gardens of Athens or the\\n library of Alexandria, the abstruse questions of\\n metaphysical science. The lofty speculations, which neither\\n convinced the understanding nor agitated the passions of the\\n Platonists themselves, were carelessly overlooked by the\\n idle, the busy, and even the studious part of mankind.(33) \\n But after the logos had been revealed as the sacred object\\n of the faith, the hope, and the religious worship of the\\n Christians, the mysterious system was embraced by a numerous\\n and increasing multitude in every province of the Roman\\n world. Those persons who, from their age, or sex, or\\n occupations, were the least qualified to judge, who were the\\n least exercised in the habits of abstract reasoning, aspired\\n to contemplate the economy of the Divine Nature: and it is\\n the boast of Tertullian (34) that a Christian mechanic could \\n readily answer such questions as had perplexed the wisest of\\n the Grecian sages. Where the subject lies so far beyond our\\n reach, the difference between the highest and the lowest of\\n human understandings may indeed be calculated as infinitely\\n small; yet the degree of weakness may perhaps be measured by\\n the degree of obstinacy and dogmatic confidence. These\\n speculations, instead of being treated as the amusement of a\\n vacant hour, became the most serious business of the\\n present, and the most useful preparation for a future life.\\n A theology which it was incumbent to believe, which it was\\n impious to doubt, and which it might be dangerous, and even\\n fatal, to mistake, became the familiar topic of private\\n meditation and popular discourse. The cold indifference of\\n philosophy was inflamed by the fervent spirit of devotion;\\n and even the metaphors of common language suggested the\\n fallacious prejudices of sense and experience. The\\n Christians, who abhorred the gross and impure generation of\\n the Greek mythology, (35) were tempted to argue from the \\n familiar analogy of the filial and paternal relations. The\\n character of Son seemed to imply a perpetual subordination\\n to the voluntary author of his existence;(36) but as the act \\n of generation, in the most spiritual and abstracted sense,\\n must be supposed to transmit the properties of a common\\n nature,(37) they durst not presume to circumscribe the powers \\n or the duration of the Son of an eternal and omnipotent\\n Father. Four-score years after the death of Christ, the\\n Christians of Bithynia declared before the tribunal of Pliny\\n that they invoked him as a god: and his divine honours have\\n been perpetuated in every age and country, by the various\\n sects who assume the name of his disciples.(38) Their tender \\n reverence for the memory of Christ, and their horror for the\\n profane worship of any created being, would have engaged\\n them to assert the equal and absolute divinity of the logos,\\n if their rapid ascent towards the throne of heaven had not\\n been imperceptibly checked by the apprehension of violating\\n the unity and sole supremacy of the great Father of Christ,\\n and of the Universe. The suspense and fluctuation produced\\n in the minds of the Christians by these opposite tendencies\\n may be observed in the writings of the theologians who\\n flourished after the end of the apostolic age and before the\\n origin of the Arian controversy. Their suffrage is claimed,\\n with equal confidence, by the orthodox and by the heretical\\n parties and the most inquisitive critics have fairly allowed\\n that, if they had the good fortune of possessing the\\n catholic verity, they have delivered their conceptions in\\n loose, inaccurate, and sometimes contradictory language.(39)\\n Authority of the church..\\nII. The devotion of individuals was the first circumstance\\n which distinguished the Christians from the Platonists: the\\n second was the authority of the church. The disciples of\\n philosophy asserted the rights of intellectual freedom, and\\n their respect for the sentiments of their teachers was a\\n liberal and voluntary tribute which they offered to superior\\n reason. But the Christians formed a numerous and disciplined\\n society; and the jurisdiction of their laws and magistrates\\n was strictly exercised over the minds of the faithful. The\\n loose wanderings of the imagination were gradually confined\\n by creeds and confessions; (40) the freedom of private judgment submitted to the public wisdom of synods; the\\n authority of a theologian was determined by his\\n ecclesiastical rank; and the episcopal successors of the\\n apostles inflicted the censures of the church on those who\\n deviated from the orthodox belief. But in an age of\\n religious controversy every act of oppression adds new force\\n to the elastic vigour of the mind; and the zeal or obstinacy\\n of a spiritual rebel was sometimes stimulated by secret\\n motives of ambition or avarice.  Factions A metaphysical argument\\n became the cause or pretence of political contests; the\\n subtleties of the Platonic school were used as the badges of\\n popular factions, and the distance which separated their\\n respective tenets was enlarged or magnified by the acrimony\\n of dispute. As long as the dark heresies of Praxeas and\\n Sabellius laboured to confound the Father with the Son, (41) \\n the orthodox party might be excused if they adhered more\\n strictly and more earnestly to the distinction than to the\\n equality of the divine persons. But as soon as the heat of\\n controversy had subsided and the progress of the Sabellians\\n was no longer an object of terror to the churches of Rome,\\n of Africa, or of Egypt, the tide of theological opinion\\n began to flow with a gentle but steady motion toward the\\n contrary extreme; and the most orthodox doctors allowed\\n themselves the use of the terms and definitions which had\\n been censured in the mouth of the sectaries.(42) After the \\n edict of toleration had restored peace and leisure to the\\n Christians, the Trinitarian controversy was revived in the\\n ancient seat of Platonism, the learned, the opulent, the\\n tumultuous city of Alexandria; and the flame of religious\\n discord was rapidly communicated from the schools to the\\n clergy, the people, the provinces, and the East. The\\n abstruse question of the eternity of the logos was agitated\\n in ecclesiastic conferences and popular sermons; and the  Arius  heterodox opinions of Arius (43) were soon made public by his  own zeal and by that of his adversaries. His most implacable adversaries have acknowledged the learning and blameless life of the eminent presbyter, who, in a former election,\\n had declined, and perhaps generously declined, his\\n pretensions to the episcopal throne. (44) His competitor  Alexander assumed the office of his judge. The important\\n cause was argued before him; and if at first he seemed to\\n hesitate, he at length pronounced his final sentence as an\\n absolute rule of faith. (45) The undaunted presbyter, who \\n presumed to resist the authority of his angry bishop, was\\n separated from the communion of the church. But the pride of\\n Arius was supported by the applause of a numerous party. He\\n reckoned among his immediate followers two bishops of Egypt,\\n seven presbyters, twelve deacons, and (what may appear\\n almost incredible) seven hundred virgins. A large majority\\n of the bishops of Asia appeared to support or favour his\\n cause; and their measures were conducted by Eusebius of\\n Caesarea, the most learned of the Christian prelates; and by\\n Eusebius of Nicomedia, who had acquired the reputation of a\\n statesman without forfeiting that of a saint. Synods in\\n Palestine and Bithynia were opposed to the synods of Egypt.\\n The attention of the prince and people was attracted by this\\n theological dispute; and the decision, at the end of six\\n years,(46) was referred to the supreme authority of the  general council of Nice.\\n \\n Three systems of the Trinity. \\nWhen the mysteries of the Christian faith were dangerously\\n exposed to public debate, it might be observed that the\\n human understanding was capable of forming three distinct,\\n though imperfect, systems concerning the nature of the\\n Divine Trinity, and it was pronounced that none of these\\n systems, in a pure and absolute sense, were exempt from\\n heresy and error. (47)\\nArianism. I. According to the first hypothesis, which was maintained by Arius and his disciples, the logos\\n was a dependent and spontaneous production, created from\\n nothing by the will of the Father. The Son, by whom all\\n things were made, (48) had been begotten before all worlds, \\n and the longest of the astronomical periods could be\\n compared only as a fleeting moment to the extent of his\\n duration; yet this duration was not infinite,(49) and there \\n had been a time which preceded the ineffable generation of\\n the logos. On this only begotten Son the Almighty Father had\\n transfused his ample spirit, and impressed the effulgence of\\n his glory. Visible image of invisible perfection, he saw, at\\n an immeasurable distance beneath his feet, the thrones of\\n the brightest archangels; yet he shone only with a reflected\\n light, and, like the sons of the Roman emperors, who were\\n invested with the titles of Caesar or Augustus, (50) he \\n governed the universe in obedience to the will of his Father\\n and Monarch. Tritheism.\\nII. In the second hypothesis, the logos\\n possessed all the inherent, incommunicable perfections which\\n religion and philosophy appropriate to the Supreme God.\\n Three distinct and infinite minds or substances, three\\n co-equal and co-eternal beings, composed the Divine Essence;\\n (51) and it would have implied contradiction that any of them \\n should not have existed, or that they should ever cease to\\n exist. (52) The advocates of a system which seemed to \\n establish three independent Deities attempted to preserve\\n the unity of the First Cause, so conspicuous in the design\\n and order of the world, by the perpetual concord of their\\n administration and the essential agreement of their will. A\\n faint resemblance of this unity of action may be discovered\\n in the societies of men, and even of animals. The causes\\n which disturb their harmony proceed only from the\\n imperfection and inequality of their faculties; but the\\n omnipotence which is guided by infinite wisdom and goodness\\n cannot fail of choosing the same means for the\\n accomplishment of the same ends. \\nSabellianism.\\nIII. Three beings, who, by the self-derived necessity of their existence, possess all  the divine attributes in the most perfect degree, who are\\n eternal in duration, infinite in space, and intimately\\n present to each other and to the whole universe,\\n irresistibly force themselves on the astonished mind as one\\n and the same Being,(53) who, in the economy of grace, as well \\n as in that of nature, may manifest himself under different\\n forms, and be considered under different aspects. By this\\n hypothesis a real substantial trinity is refined into a\\n trinity of names and abstract modifications that subsist\\n only in the mind which conceives them. The logos is no\\n longer a person, but an attribute; and it is only in a\\n figurative sense that the epithet of Son can be applied to\\n the eternal reason which was with God from the beginning,\\n and by which, not by whom, all things were made. The\\n incarnation of the logos is reduced to a mere inspiration of\\n the Divine Wisdom, which filled the soul and directed all\\n the actions of the man Jesus. Thus, after revolving round\\n the theological circle, we are surprised to find that the\\n Sabellian ends where the Ebionite had begun, and that the\\n incomprehensible mystery which excites our adoration eludes\\n our inquiry(54)\\n Council of Nice, A.D. 325. \\n If the bishops of the council of Nice(55) had been permitted \\n to follow the unbiassed dictates of their conscience, Arius\\n and his associates could scarcely have flattered themselves\\n with the hopes of obtaining a majority of votes in favour of\\n an hypothesis so directly adverse to the two most popular\\n opinions of the catholic world. The Arians soon perceived\\n the danger of their situation, and prudently assumed those\\n modest virtues which, in the fury of civil and religious\\n dissensions, are seldom practised, or even praised, except\\n by the weaker party. They recommended the exercise of\\n Christian charity and moderation, urged the incomprehensible\\n nature of the controversy, disclaimed the use of any terms\\n or definitions which could not be found in the Scriptures,\\n and offered, by very liberal concessions, to satisfy their\\n adversaries without renouncing the integrity of their own\\n principles. The victorious faction received all their\\n proposals with haughty suspicion, and anxiously sought for\\n some irreconcilable mark of distinction, the rejection of\\n which might involve the Arians in the guilt and consequences\\n of heresy. A letter was publicly read and ignominiously\\n torn, in which their patron, Eusebius of Nicomedia,\\n ingenuously confessed that the admission of the HOMOOUSION, or Consubstantial, a word already familiar to the Platonists, was incompatible with the principles of their\\n theological system. The fortunate opportunity was eagerly\\n embraced by the bishops, who governed the resolutions of the\\n synod, and, according to the lively expressions of Ambrose,\\n (56) they used the sword, which heresy itself had drawn from  the scabbard, to cut off the head of the hated monster. The consubstantiality of the Father and the Son was established\\n by the council of Nice, and has been unanimously received as\\n a fundamental article of the Christian faith by the consent\\n of the Greek, the Latin, the Oriental, and the Protestant\\n churches. But if the same word had not served to stigmatise\\n the heretics and to unite the catholics, it would have been\\n inadequate to the purpose of the majority by whom it was\\n introduced into the orthodox creed. This majority was\\n divided into two parties, distinguished by a contrary\\n tendency to the sentiments of the Tritheists and of the\\n Sabellians. But as those opposite extremes seemed to\\n overthrow the foundations either of natural or revealed\\n religion, they mutually agreed to qualify the rigour of\\n their principles, and to disavow the just, but invidious,\\n consequences which might be urged by their antagonists. The\\n interest of the common cause inclined them to join their\\n numbers and to conceal their differences; their animosity\\n was softened by the healing counsels of toleration, and\\n their disputes were suspended by the use of the mysterious\\n Homoousion, which either party was free to interpret\\n according to their peculiar tenets. The Sabellian sense,\\n which, about fifty years before, had obliged the council of\\n Antioch(57) to prohibit this celebrated term, had endeared it \\n to those theologians who entertained a secret but partial\\n affection for a nominal Trinity. But the more fashionable\\n saints of the Arian times, the intrepid Athanasius, the\\n learned Gregory Nazianzen, and the other pillars of the\\n church, who supported with ability and success the Nicene\\n doctrine, appeared to consider the expression of substance\\n as if it had been synonymous with that of nature; and they\\n ventured to illustrate their meaning by affirming that three\\n men, as they belong to the same common species, are\\n consubstantial or homoousian to each other.(58) This pure and \\n distinct equality was tempered, on the one hand, by the\\n internal connection and spiritual penetration which\\n indissolubly unites the divine persons; (59) and, on the \\n other, by the pre-eminence of the Father, which was\\n acknowledged as far as it is compatible with the\\n independence of the Son. (60) Within these limits the almost \\n invisible and tremulous ball of orthodoxy was allowed\\n securely to vibrate. On either side, beyond this consecrated\\n ground, the heretics and the daemons lurked in ambush to\\n surprise and devour the unhappy wanderer. But as the degrees\\n of theological hatred depend on the spirit of the war rather\\n than on the importance of the controversy, the heretics who\\n degraded were treated with more severity than those who\\n annihilated the person of the Son. The life of Athanasius\\n was consumed in irreconcilable opposition to the impious\\n madness of the Arians,(61) but he defended above twenty years \\n the Sabellianism of Marcellus of Ancyra; and when at last he\\n was compelled to withdraw himself from his communion, he\\n continued to mention with an ambiguous smile the venial\\n errors of his respectable friend.(62)\\n Arian Creeds. \\nThe authority of a general council, to which the Arians\\n themselves had been compelled to submit, inscribed on the\\n banners of the orthodox party the mysterious characters of\\n the word Homoousion, which essentially contributed,\\n notwithstanding some obscure disputes, some nocturnal\\n combats, to maintain and perpetuate the uniformity of faith,\\n or at least of language. The Consubstantialists, who by\\n their success have deserved and obtained the title of\\n Catholics, gloried in the simplicity and steadiness of their\\n own creed, and insulted the repeated variations of their\\n adversaries, who were destitute of any certain rule of\\n faith. The sincerity or the cunning of the Arian chiefs, the\\n fear of the laws or of the people, their reverence for\\n Christ, their hatred of Athanasius, all the causes, human\\n and divine, that influence and disturb the counsels of a\\n theological faction, introduced among the sectaries a spirit\\n of discord and inconstancy which in the course of a few\\n years erected eighteen different models of religion,(63) and  avenged the violated dignity of the church. The zealous Hilary, (64) who, from the peculiar hardships of his  situation, was inclined to extenuate rather than to aggravate the errors of the Oriental clergy, declares that,\\n in the wide extent of the ten provinces of Asia to which he\\n had been banished, there could be found very few prelates\\n who had preserved the knowledge of the true God.(65) The oppression which he had felt, the disorders of which he was the spectator and the victim, appeased, during a short interval, the angry passions of his soul and in the\\n following passage, of which I shall transcribe a few lines,\\n the bishop of Poitiers unwarily deviates into the style of a\\n Christian philosopher.  Arian Sects \\n It will not be expected, it would not perhaps be endured,\\n that I should swell this theological digression by. a minute\\n examination of the eighteen creeds, the authors of which,\\n for the most part, disclaimed the odious name of their\\n parent Arius. It is amusing enough to delineate the form,\\n and to trace the vegetation, of a singular plant; but the\\n tedious detail of leaves without flowers, and of branches\\n without fruit, would soon exhaust the patience and\\n disappoint the curiosity of the laborious student. One\\n question, which gradually arose from the Arian controversy,\\n may, however, be noticed, as it served to produce and\\n discriminate the three sects who were united only by their\\n common aversion to the Homoousion of the Nicene synod. 1/.\\n If they were asked whether the Son was like unto the Father,\\n the question was resolutely answered in the negative by the\\n heretics who adhered to the principles of Arius, or indeed\\n to those of philosophy, which seem to establish an infinite\\n difference between the Creator and the most excellent of his\\n creatures. This obvious consequence was maintained by\\n Aetius,(67) on whom the zeal of his adversaries bestowed the surname of the Atheist. His restless and aspiring spirit  urged him to try almost every profession of human life. He\\n was successively a slave, or at least a husbandman, a\\n travelling tinker, a goldsmith, a physician, a schoolmaster,\\n a theologian, and at last the apostle of a new church, which\\n was propagated by the abilities of his disciple Eunomius.(68)   Armed with texts of Scripture, and with captious syllogisms\\n from the logic of Aristotle, the subtle Aetius had acquired\\n the fame of an invincible disputant, whom it was impossible\\n either to silence or to convince. Such talents engaged the\\n friendship of the Arian bishops, till they were forced to\\n renounce and even to persecute a dangerous ally, who, by the\\n accuracy of his reasoning, had prejudiced their cause in the\\n popular opinion, and offended the piety of their most\\n devoted followers. 2/. The omnipotence of the Creator\\n suggested a specious and respectful solution of the likeness\\n of the Father and the Son; and faith might humbly receive\\n what reason could not presume to deny, that the Supreme God\\n might communicate his infinite perfections, and create a\\n being similar only to himself. (69) These Arians were \\n powerfully supported by the weight and abilities of their\\n leaders, who had succeeded to the management of the Eusebian\\n interest, and who occupied the principal thrones of the\\n East. They detested, perhaps with some affectation, the\\n impiety of Aetius; they professed to believe, either without\\n reserve or according to the Scriptures, that the Son was\\n different from all other creatures, and similar only to the\\n Father. But they denied that he was either of the same or of\\n a similar substance; sometimes boldly justifying their\\n dissent, and sometimes objecting to the use of the word\\n substance, which seems to imply an adequate, or at least a\\n distinct, notion of the nature of the Diety. 3/. The sect\\n which asserted the doctrine of a similar substance was the\\n most numerous, at least in the provinces of Asia; and when\\n the leaders of both parties were assembled in the council of\\n Seleucia, (70) their opinion would have prevailed by a majority of one hundred and five to forty-three bishops. The\\n Greek word which was chosen to express this mysterious\\n resemblance bears so close an affinity to the orthodox\\n symbol, that the profane of every age have derided the\\n furious contests which the difference of a single diphthong\\n excited between the Homoousians and the Homoiousians. As it\\n frequently happens that the sounds and characters which\\n approach the nearest to each other accidentally represent\\n the most opposite ideas, the observation would be itself\\n ridiculous, if it were possible to mark any real and\\n sensible distinction between the doctrine of the\\n Semi-Arians, as they were improperly styled, and that of the\\n Catholics themselves. The bishop of Poitiers, who in his\\n Phrygian exile very wisely aimed at a coalition of parties,\\n endeavours to prove that, by a pious and faithful\\n interpretation,(71) the Homoiousion may be reduced to a consubstantial sense. Yet he confesses that the word has a\\n dark and suspicious aspect; and, as if darkness were\\n congenial to theological disputes, the Semi-Arians, who\\n advanced to the doors of the church, assailed them with the\\n most unrelenting fury.\\n \\n Faith of the Western or Latin church \\n The provinces of Egypt and Asia, which cultivated the\\n language and manners of the Greeks, had deeply imbibed the\\n venom of the Arian controversy. The familiar study of the\\n Platonic system, a vain and argumentative disposition, a\\n copious and flexible idiom, supplied the clergy and people\\n of the East with an inexhaustible flow of words and\\n distinctions; and, in the midst of their fierce contentions,\\n they easily forgot the doubt which is recommended by\\n philosophy, and the submission which is enjoined by\\n religion. The inhabitants of the West were of a less\\n inquisitive spirit, their passions were not so forcibly\\n moved by invisible objects, their minds were less frequently\\n exercised by the habits of dispute; and such was the happy\\n ignorance of the Gallican church, that Hilary himself, above\\n thirty years after the first general council, was still a\\n stranger to the Nicene creed.(72) The Latins had received the \\n rays of divine knowledge through the dark and doubtful\\n medium of a translation. The poverty and stubbornness of\\n their native tongue was not always capable of affording just\\n equivalents for the Greek terms, for the technical words of\\n the Platonic philosophy, (73) which had been consecrated, by \\n the Gospel or by the church, to express the mysteries of the\\n Christian faith, and a verbal defect might introduce into\\n the Latin theology a long train of error or perplexity.(74) \\n But as the western provincials had the good fortune of\\n deriving their religion from an orthodox source, they\\n preserved with steadiness the doctrine which they had\\n accepted with docility; and when the Arian pestilence\\n approached their frontiers, they were supplied with the\\n seasonable preservative of the Homoousion by the paternal\\n care of the Roman pontiff. Council of Rimi, A.D. 360  Their sentiments and their temper\\n were displayed in the memorable synod of Rimini, which\\n surpassed in numbers the council of Nice, since it was\\n composed of above four hundred bishops of Italy, Africa,\\n Spain, Gaul, Britain, and Illyricum. From the first debates\\n it appeared that only four score prelates adhered to the\\n party, though they affected to anathematise the name and\\n memory of Arius. But this inferiority was compensated by the\\n advantages of skill, of experience, and of discipline; and\\n the minority was conducted by Valens and Ursacius, two\\n bishops of Illyricum, who had spent their lives in the\\n intrigues of courts and councils, and who had been trained\\n under the Eusebian banner in the religious wars of the East.\\n By their arguments and negotiations they embarrassed, they\\n confounded, they at last deceived the honest simplicity of\\n the Latin bishops, who suffered the palladium of the faith\\n to be extorted from their hands by fraud and importunity,\\n rather than by open violence. The council of Rimini was not\\n allowed to separate till the members had imprudently\\n subscribed a captious creed, in which some expressions,\\n susceptible of an heretical sense, were inserted in the room\\n of the Homoousion. It was on this occasion that, according\\n to Jerom, the world was surprised to find itself Arian.(75) \\n But the bishops of the Latin provinces had no sooner reached\\n their respective dioceses than they discovered their\\n mistake, and repented of their weakness. The ignominious\\n capitulation was rejected with disdain and abhorrence, and\\n the Homoousian standard, which had been shaken but not\\n overthrown, was more firmly replanted in all the churches of\\n the West.(76)\\n Conduct of the emperors in the Arian controvesy \\n Such was the rise and progress, and such were the natural\\n revolutions, of those theological disputes which disturbed\\n the peace of Christianity under the reigns of Constantine\\n and of his sons. But as those princes presumed to extend\\n their despotism over the faith, as well as over the lives\\n and fortunes of their subjects, the weight of their suffrage\\n sometimes inclined the ecclesiastical balance: and the\\n prerogatives of the King of Heaven were settled, or changed,\\n or modified, in the cabinet of an earthly monarch.\\n \\n Indifference of Constantine, A.D. 324 \\n The unhappy spirit of discord which pervaded the provinces\\n of the East interrupted the triumph of Constantine; but the\\n emperor continued for some time to view with cool and\\n careless indifference the object of the dispute. As he was\\n yet ignorant of the difficulty of appeasing the quarrels of\\n theologians, he addressed to the contending parties, to\\n Alexander and to Arius, a moderating epistle;(77) which may \\n be ascribed with far greater reason to the untutored sense\\n of a soldier and statesman than to the dictates of any of\\n his episcopal counsellors. He attributes the origin of the\\n whole controversy to a trifling and subtle question\\n concerning an incomprehensible point of the law, which was\\n foolishly asked by the bishop, and imprudently resolved by\\n the presbyter. He laments that the Christian people, who had\\n the same God, the same religion, and the same worship,\\n should be divided by such inconsiderable distinctions; and\\n he seriously recommends to the clergy of Alexandria the\\n example of the Greek philosophers, who could maintain their\\n arguments without losing their temper and assert their\\n freedom without violating their friendship. The indifference\\n and contempt of the sovereign would have been, perhaps, the\\n most effectual method of silencing the dispute, if the\\n popular current had been less rapid and impetuous, and if\\n Constantine himself, in the midst of faction and fanaticism,\\n could have preserved the calm possession of his own mind.\\n But his ecclesiastical ministers soon contrived to seduce\\n the impartiality of the magistrate, and to awaken the zeal\\n of the proselyte. His zeal. A.D. 325  He was provoked by the insults which had\\n been offered to his statues; he was alarmed by the real as\\n well as the imaginary magnitude of the spreading mischief;\\n and he extinguished the hope of peace and toleration, from\\n the moment that he assembled three hundred bishops within\\n the walls of the same palace. The presence of the monarch\\n swelled the importance of the debate; his attention\\n multiplied the arguments; and he exposed his person with a\\n patient intrepidity which animated the valour of the\\n combatants. Notwithstanding the applause which has been\\n bestowed on the eloquence and sagacity of Constantine,(78) a \\n Roman general, whose religion might be still a subject of\\n doubt, and whose mind had not been enlightened either by\\n study or by inspiration, was indifferently qualified to\\n discuss, in the Greek language, a metaphysical question, or\\n an article of faith. But the credit of his favourite Osius,\\n who appears to have presided in the council of Nice, might\\n dispose the emperor in favour of the orthodox party; and a\\n well-timed insinuation, that the same Eusebius of Nicomedia,\\n who now protected the heretic, had lately assisted the\\n tyrant,(79) might exasperate him against their adversaries. \\n The Nicene creed was ratified by Constantine; and his firm\\n declaration, that those who resisted the divine judgment of\\n the synod must prepare themselves for an immediate exile,\\n annihilated the murmurs of a feeble opposition; which, from\\n seventeen, was almost instantly reduced to two, protesting\\n bishops. Eusebius of Casarea yielded a reluctant and\\n ambiguous consent to the homoousion; (80) and the wavering \\n conduct of the Nicomedian Eusebius served only to delay\\n about three months his disgrace and exile.(81)He persecutes the Arian  The impious Arius was banished into one of the remote provinces of Illyricum; his person and disciples were branded, by law,\\n with the odious name of Porphyrians; his writings were\\n condemned to the flames, and a capital punishment was\\n denounced against those in whose possession they should be\\n found. The emperor had now imbibed the spirit of\\n controversy, and the angry sarcastic style of his edicts was\\n designed to inspire his subjects with the hatred which he\\n had conceived against the enemies of Christ.(82)\\n and the orthodox party, A.D. 328-337 \\n But, as if the conduct of the emperor had been guided by\\n passion instead of principle, three years from the council\\n of Nice were scarcely elapsed before he discovered some\\n symptoms of mercy, and even of indulgence, towards the\\n proscribed sect, which was secretly protected by his\\n favourite sister. The exiles were recalled; and Eusebius,\\n who gradually resumed his influence over the mind of\\n Constantine, was restored to the episcopal throne, from\\n which he had been ignominiously degraded. Arius himself was\\n treated by the whole court with the respect which would have\\n been due to an innocent and oppressed man. His faith was\\n approved by the synod of Jerusalem; and the emperor seemed\\n impatient to repair his injustice, by issuing an absolute\\n command that he should be solemnly admitted to the communion\\n in the cathedral of Constantinople. On the same day which\\n had been fixed for the triumph of Arius, he expired; and the\\n strange and horrid circumstances of his death might excite a\\n suspicion that the orthodox saints had contributed more\\n efficaciously than by their prayers to deliver the church\\n from the most formidable of her enemies. (83) The three \\n principal leaders of the catholics, Athanasius of\\n Alexandria, Eustathius of Antioch, and Paul of\\n Constantinople, were deposed on various accusations, by the\\n sentence of numerous councils; and were afterwards banished\\n into distant provinces by the first of the Christian\\n emperors, who, in the last moments of his life received the\\n rites of baptism from the Arian bishop of Nicomedia. The\\n ecclesiastical government of Constantine cannot be justified\\n from the reproach of levity and weakness. But the credulous\\n monarch, unskilled in the stratagems of theological warfare,\\n might be deceived by the modest and specious professions of\\n the heretics, whose sentiments he never perfectly\\n understood; and while he protected Arius, and persecuted\\n Athanasius, he still considered the council of Nice as the\\n bulwark of the Christian faith, and the peculiar glory of\\n his own reign.(84)\\n Constantius favours the Arians, A.D. 337-361. \\nThe sons of Constantine must have been admitted from their\\n childhood into the rank of catechumens, but they imitated,\\n in the delay of their baptism, the example of their father.\\n Like him, they presumed to pronounce their judgment on\\n mysteries into which they had never been regularly\\n initiated:(85) and the fate of the Trinitarian controversy \\n depended, in a great measure, on the sentiments of\\n Constantius, who inherited the provinces of the East, and\\n acquired the possession of the whole empire. The Arian\\n presbyter or bishop, who had secreted for his use the\\n testament of the deceased emperor, improved the fortunate\\n occasion which had introduced him to the familiarity of a\\n prince whose public counsels were always swayed by his\\n domestic favourites. The eunuchs and slaves diffused the\\n spiritual poison through the palace, and the dadangerous\\n infection was communicated by the female attendants to the\\n guards, and by the empress to her unsuspicious husband.(86) \\n The partiality which Constantius always expressed towards\\n the Eusebian faction was insensibly fortified by the\\n dexterous management of their leaders; and his victory over\\n the tyrant Magnentius increased his inclination, as well as\\n ability, to employ the arms of power in the cause of\\n Arianism. While the two armies were engaged in the plains of\\n Mursa, and the fate of the two rivals depended on the chance\\n of war, the son of Constantine passed the anxious moments in\\n a church of the martyrs, under the walls of the city. His\\n spiritual comforter, Valens, the Arian bishop of the\\n diocese, employed the most artful precautions to obtain such\\n early intelligence as might secure either his favour or his\\n escape. A secret chain of swift and trusty messengers\\n informed him of the vicissitudes of the battle; and while\\n the courtiers stood trembling round their affrighted master,\\n Valens assured him that the Gallic legions gave way; and\\n insinuated, with some presence of mind, that the glorious\\n event had been revealed to him by an angel. The grateful\\n emperor ascribed his success to the merits and intercession\\n of the bishop of Mursa, whose faith had deserved the public\\n and miraculous approbation of Heaven. (87) The Arians, who \\n considered as their own the victory of Constantius,\\n preferred his glory to that of his father.(88) Cyril, bishop \\n of Jerusalem, immediately composed the description of a\\n celestial cross, encircled with a splendid rainbow, which,\\n during the festival of Pentecost, about the third hour of\\n the day, had appeared over the Mount of Olives, to the\\n edification of the devout pilgrims and the people of the\\n holy city. (89) The size of the meteor was gradually \\n magnified; and the Arian historian has ventured to affirm\\n that it was conspicuous to the two armies in the plains of\\n Pannonia; and that the tyrant, who is purposely represented\\n as an idolater, fled before the auspicious sign of orthodox\\n Christianity.(90)\\n Arian Councils \\n The sentiments of a judicious stranger, who has impartially\\n considered the progress of civil or ecclesiastical discord,\\n are always entitled to our notice: and a short passage of\\n Ammianus, who served in the armies, and studied the\\n character, of Constantius, is perhaps of more value than\\n many pages of theologic invectives.   Our more intimate knowledge of the ecclesiastical transactions of the reign of Constantius would furnish an ample commentary on this remarkable\\n passage; which justifies the rational apprehensions of Athanasius, that the restless activity of the clergy, who wandered round the empire in search of the true faith, would excite the contempt and laughter of the unbelieving world. (92) As soon as the emperor was relieved from the terrors of  the civil war, he devoted the leisure of his winter quarters at Arles, Milan, Sirmium, and Constantinople, to the amusement or toils of controversy: the sword of the magistrate, and even of the tyrant, was unsheathed, to enforce the reasons of the theologian; and as he opposed the orthodox faith of Nice, it is readily confessed that his incapacity and ignorance were equal to his presumption.(93) \\n The eunuchs, the women, and the bishops, who governed the\\n vain and feeble mind of the emperor, had inspired him with\\n an insuperable dislike to the Homoousion; but his timid\\n conscience was alarmed by the impiety of Aetius. The guilt\\n of that atheist was aggravated by the suspicious favour of\\n the unfortunate Gallus; and even the deaths of the Imperial\\n ministers who had been massacred at Antioch were imputed to\\n the suggestions of that dangerous sophist. The mind of\\n Constantius, which could neither be moderated by reason nor\\n fixed by faith, was blindly impelled to either side of the\\n dark and empty abyss by his horror of the opposite extreme;\\n he alternately embraced and condemned the sentiments, he\\n successively banished and recalled the leaders, of the Arian\\n and Semi-Arian factions. (94) During the season of public \\n business or festivity, he employed whole days, and even\\n nights, in selecting the words, and weighing the syllables,\\n which composed his fluctuating creeds. The subject of his\\n meditations still pursued and occupied his slumbers: the\\n incoherent dreams of the emperor were received as celestial\\n visions, and he accepted with complacency the lofty title of\\n bishop of bishops, from those ecclesiastics who forgot the\\n interest of their order for the gratification of their\\n passions. The design of establishing an uniformity of\\n doctrine, which had engaged him to convene so many synods in\\n Gaul, Italy, Illyricum, and Asia, was repeatedly baffled by\\n his own levity, by the divisions of the Arians, and by the\\n resistance of the catholics; and he resolved, as the last\\n and decisive effort, imperiously to dictate the decrees of a\\n general council. The destructive earthquake of Nicomedia,\\n the difficulty of finding a convenient place, and perhaps\\n some secret motives of policy, produced an alteration in the\\n summons. The bishops of the East were directed to meet at\\n Seleucia, in Isauria; while those of the West held their\\n deliberations at Rimini, on the coast of the Hadriatic, and\\n instead of two or three deputies from each province, the\\n whole episcopal body was ordered to march. The Eastern\\n council, after consuming four days in fierce and unavailing\\n debate, separated without any definite conclusion. The\\n council of the West was protracted till the seventh month.\\n Taurus, the Praetorian praefect, was instructed not to\\n dismiss the prelates till they should all be united in the\\n same opinion; and his efforts were supported by a power of\\n banishing fifteen of the most refractory, and a promise of\\n the consulship if he achieved so difficult an adventure. His\\n prayers and threats, the authority of the sovereign, the\\n sophistry of Valens and Ursacius, the distress of cold and\\n hunger, and the tedious melancholy of a hopeless exile, at\\n length extorted the reluctant consent of the bishops of\\n Rimini. The deputies of the East and of the West attended\\n the emperor in the palace of Constantinople, and he enjoyed\\n the satisfaction of imposing on the world a profession of\\n faith which established the likeness, without expressing the\\n consubstantiality, of the Son of God.(95) But the triumph of \\n Arianism had been preceded by the removal of the orthodox\\n clergy, whom it was impossible either to intimidate or to\\n corrupt; and the reign of Constantius was disgraced by the\\n unjust and ineffectual persecution of the great Athanasius.\\n \\n Character and adventures of Athanasius \\n We have seldom an opportunity of observing, either in active\\n or speculative life, what effect may be produced, or what\\n obstacles may be surmounted, by the force of a single mind,\\n when it is inflexibly applied to the pursuit of a single\\n object. The immortal name of Athanasius (96) will never be \\n separated from the catholic doctrine of the Trinity, to\\n whose defence he consecrated every moment and every faculty\\n of his being. Educated in the family of Alexander, he had\\n vigorously opposed the early progress of the Arian heresy:\\n he exercised the important functions of secretary under the\\n aged prelate; and the fathers of the Nicene council beheld\\n with surprise and respect the rising virtues of the young\\n deacon. In a time of public danger the dull claims of age\\n and of rank are sometimes superseded; and within five months\\n after his return from Nice the deacon Athanasius was seated\\n on the archiepiscopal throne of Egypt. He filled that\\n eminent station above forty-six years, and his long\\n administration was spent in a perpetual combat against the\\n powers of Arianism. Five times was Athanasius expelled from\\n his throne; twenty years he passed as an exile or a\\n fugitive; and almost every province of the Roman empire was\\n successively witness to his merit, and his sufferings in the\\n cause of the Homoousion, which he considered as the sole\\n pleasure and business, as the duty and as the glory of his\\n life. Amidst the storms of persecution, the archbishop of\\n Alexandria was patient of labour, jealous of fame, careless\\n of safety; and although his mind was tainted by the\\n contagion of fanaticism, Athanasius displayed a superiority\\n of character and abilities which would have qualified him,\\n far better than the degenerate sons of Constantine, for the\\n government of a great monarchy. His learning was much less\\n profound and extensive than that of Eusebius of Caesarea,\\n and his rude eloquence could not be compared with the\\n polished oratory of Gregory or Basil; but whenever the\\n primate of Egypt was called upon to justify his sentiments\\n or his conduct, his unpremeditated style, either of speaking\\n or writing, was clear, forcible, and persuasive. He has\\n always been revered in the orthodox school as one of the\\n most accurate masters of the Christian theology; and he was\\n supposed to possess two profane sciences, less adapted to\\n the episcopal character — the knowledge of jurisprudence,(97) \\n and that of divination. (98) Some fortunate conjectures of \\n future events, which impartial reasoners might ascribe to\\n the experience and judgment of Athanasius, were attributed\\n by his friends to heavenly inspiration, and imputed by his\\n enemies to infernal magic.\\n \\n   But as Athanasius was continually engaged with the\\n prejudices and passions of every order of men, from the monk\\n to the emperor, the knowledge of human nature was his first\\n and most important science. He preserved a distinct and\\n unbroken view of a scene which was incessantly shifting; and\\n never failed to improve those decisive moments which are\\n irrecoverably past before they are perceived by a common\\n eye. The archbishop of Alexandria was capable of\\n distinguishing how far he might boldly command, and where he\\n must dexterously insinuate; how long he might contend with\\n power, and when he must withdraw from persecution; and while\\n he directed the thunders of the church against heresy and\\n rebellion, he could assume, in the bosom of his own party,\\n the flexible and indulgent temper of a prudent leader. The\\n election of Athanasius has not escaped the reproach of\\n irregularity and precipitation; (99) but the propriety of his \\n behaviour conciliated the affections both of the clergy and\\n of the people. The Alexandrians were impatient to rise in\\n arms for the defence of an eloquent and liberal pastor. In\\n his distress he always derived support, or at least\\n consolation, from the faithful attachment of his parochial\\n clergy; and the hundred bishops of Egypt adhered, with\\n unshaken zeal, to the cause of Athanasius. In the modest\\n equipage which pride and policy would affect, he frequently\\n performed the episcopal visitation of his provinces, from\\n the mouth of the Nile to the confines of Ethiopia;\\n familiarly conversing with the meanest of the populace, and\\n humbly saluting the saints and hermits of the desert.(100) \\n Nor was it only in ecclesiastical assemblies, among men\\n whose education and manners were similar to his own, that\\n Athanasius displayed the ascendancy of his genius. He\\n appeared with easy and respectful firmness in the courts of\\n princes; and in the various turns of his prosperous and\\n adverse fortune he never lost the confidence of his friends,\\n or the esteem of his enemies.\\n \\n Persecution against Athanasius, A.D. 330 \\nIn his youth the primate of Egypt resisted the great\\n Constantine, who had repeatedly signified his will that\\n Arius should be restored to the catholic communion.(101) The \\n emperor respected, and might forgive, this inflexible\\n resolution; and the faction who considered Athanasius as\\n their most formidable enemy were constrained to dissemble\\n their hatred, and silently to prepare an indirect and\\n distant assault. They scattered rumours and suspicions,\\n represented the archbishop as a proud and oppressive tyrant,\\n and boldly accused him of violating the treaty which had\\n been ratified in the Nicene council with the schismatic\\n followers of Meletius.(102) Athanasius had openly disapproved \\n that ignominious peace, and the emperor was disposed to\\n believe that he had abused his ecclesiastical and civil\\n power to persecute those odious sectaries; that he had\\n sacrilegiously broken a chalice in one of their churches of\\n Maraeotis; that he had whipped or imprisoned six of their\\n bishops; and that Arsenius, a seventh bishop of the same\\n party, had been murdered, or at least mutilated, by the\\n cruel hand of the primate.(103) These charges, which affected \\n his honour and his life, were referred by Constantine to his\\n brother Dalmatius, the censor, who resided at Antioch; the\\n synods of Caesarea and Tyre were successively convened; and\\n the bishops of the East were instructed to judge the cause\\n of Athanasius before they proceeded to consecrate the new\\n church of the Resurrection at Jerusalem. The primate might\\n be conscious of his innocence; but he was sensible that the\\n same implacable spirit which had dictated the accusation\\n would direct the proceeding and pronounce the sentence. He\\n prudently declined the tribunal of his enemies, despised the\\n summons of the synod of Caesarea; and, after a long and\\n artful delay, submitted to the peremptory commands of the\\n emperor, who threatened to punish his criminal disobedience\\n if he refused to appear in the council of Tyre.(104) Before \\n Athanasius, at the head of fifty Egyptian prelates, sailed\\n from Alexandria, he had wisely secured the alliance of the\\n Meletians; and Arsenius himself, his imaginary victim, and\\n his secret friend, was privately concealed in his train. The\\n synod of Tyre was conducted by Eusebius of Caesarea, with\\n more passion, and with less art, than his learning and\\n experience might promise; his numerous faction repeated the\\n names of homicide and tyrant; and their clamours were\\n encouraged by the seeming patience of Athanasius, who\\n expected the decisive moment to produce Arsenius alive and\\n unhurt in the midst of the assembly. The nature of the other\\n charges did not admit of such clear and satisfactory\\n replies; yet, the archbishop was able to prove that, in the\\n village where he was accused of breaking a consecrated\\n chalice, neither church nor altar nor chalice could really\\n exist. The Arians, who had secretly determined the guilt and\\n condemnation of their enemy, attempted, however, to disguise\\n their injustice by the imitation of judicial forms; the\\n synod appointed an episcopal commission of six delegates to\\n collect evidence on the spot; and this measure, which was\\n vigorously opposed by the Egyptian bishops, opened new\\n scenes of violence and perjury.(105) After the return of the \\n deputies from Alexandria, the majority of the council\\n pronounced the final sentence of degradation and exile\\n against the primate of Egypt. The decree, expressed in the\\n fiercest language of malice and revenge, was communicated to\\n the emperor and the Catholic church; and the bishops\\n immediately resumed a mild and devout aspect, such as became\\n their holy pilgrimage to the Sepulchre of Christ.(106)\\n His first exile, A.D. 336 \\nBut the injustice of these ecclesiastical judges had not\\n been countenanced by the submission, or even by the\\n presence, of Athanasius. He resolved to make a bold; and\\n dangerous experiment, whether the throne was inaccessible to\\n the voice of truth; and before the final sentence could be\\n pronounced at Tyre, the intrepid primate threw himself into\\n a bark which was ready to hoist sale for the Imperial city.\\n The request of a formal audience might have been opposed or\\n eluded; but Athanasius concealed his arrival, watched the\\n moment of Constantine\\'s return from an adjacent villa, and\\n boldly encountered his angry sovereign as he passed on\\n horseback through the principal street of Constantinople. So\\n strange an apparition excited his surprise and indignation;\\n and the guards were ordered to remove the importunate\\n suitor; but his resentment was subdued by involuntary\\n respect; and the haughty spirit of the emperor was awed by\\n the courage and eloquence of a bishop who implored his\\n justice and awakened his conscience. (107) Constantine \\n listened to the complaints of Athanasius with impartial and\\n even gracious attention; the members of the synod of Tyre\\n were summoned to justify their proceedings and the arts of\\n the Eusebian faction would have been confounded if they had\\n not aggravated the guilt of the primate by the dexterous\\n supposition of an unpardonable offence — a criminal design\\n to intercept and detain the corn-fleet of Alexandria, which\\n supplied the subsistence of the new capital.(108) The emperor \\n was satisfied that the peace of Egypt would be secured by\\n the absence of a popular leader but he refused to fill the\\n vacancy of the archiepiscopal throne; and the sentence\\n which, after long hesitation, he pronounced, was that of a\\n jealous ostracism rather than of an ignominious exile. In\\n the remote province of Gaul, but in the hospitable court of\\n Treves, Athanasius passed about twenty-eight months. and restoration, A.D. 338.  The\\n death of the emperor changed the face of public affairs;\\n and, amidst the general indulgence of a young reign, the\\n primate was restored to his country by an honourable edict\\n of the younger Constantine, who expressed a deep sense of\\n the innocence and merit of his venerable guest.(109)\\n His second exile, A.D. 341 \\n The death of that prince exposed Athanasius to a second\\n persecution; and the feeble Constantius, the sovereign of\\n the East, soon became the secret accomplice of the\\n Eusebians. Ninety bishops of that sect or faction assembled\\n at Antioch under the specious pretence of dedicating the\\n cathedral. They composed an ambiguous creed, which is\\n faintly tinged with the colours of Semi-Arianism, and\\n twenty-five canons, which still regulate the discipline of\\n the orthodox Greeks. (110) It was decided, with some \\n appearance of equity, that a bishop, deprived by a synod,\\n should not resume his episcopal functions till he had been\\n absolved by the judgment of an equal synod; the law was\\n immediately applied to the case of Athanasius; the council\\n of Antioch pronounced, or rather confirmed, his degradation:\\n a stranger, named Gregory, was seated on his throne; and\\n Philagrius,(111) the praefect of Egypt, was instructed to \\n support the new primate with the civil and military powers\\n of the province. Oppressed by the conspiracy of the Asiatic\\n prelates, Athanasius withdrew from Alexandria and passed\\n three years(112) as an exile and a suppliant on the holy \\n threshold of the Vatican.(113) By the assiduous study of the \\n Latin language he soon qualified himself to negotiate with\\n the western clergy; his decent flattery swayed and directed\\n the haughty Julius: the Roman pontiff was persuaded to\\n consider his appeal as the peculiar interest of the\\n Apostolic see; and his innocence was unanimously declared in\\n a council of fifty bishops of Italy. At the end of three\\n years the primate was summoned to the court of Milan by the\\n emperor Constans, who, in the indulgence of unlawful\\n pleasures, still professed a lively regard for the orthodox\\n faith. The cause of truth and justice was promoted by the\\n influence of gold,(114) and the ministers of Constans advised \\n their sovereign to require the convocation of an\\n ecclesiastical assembly, which might act as the\\n representatives of the Catholic church. Ninety-four bishops\\n of the West, seventy-six bishops of the East, encountered\\n each other at Sardica, on the verge of the two empires, but\\n in the dominions of the protector of Athanasius. Their\\n debates soon degenerated into hostile altercations; the\\n Asiatics, apprehensive for their personal safety, retired to\\n Philippopolis in Thrace; and the rival synods reciprocally\\n hurled their spiritual thunders against their enemies, whom\\n they piously condemned as the enemies of the true God. Their\\n decrees were published and ratified in their respective\\n provinces: and Athanasius, who in the West was revered as a\\n saint, was exposed as a criminal to the abhorrence of the\\n East.(115) The council of Sardica reveals the first symptoms \\n of discord and schism between the Greek and Latin churches,\\n which were separated by the accidental difference of faith\\n and the permanent distinction of language.\\n \\n and restoration, A.D. 349 \\nDuring his second exile in the West, Athanasius was\\n frequently admitted to the Imperial presence — at Capua,\\n Lodi, Milan, Verona, Padua, Aquileia, and Treves. The bishop\\n of the diocese usually assisted at these interviews; the\\n master of the offices stood before the veil or curtain of\\n the sacred apartment; and the uniform moderation of the\\n primate might be attested by these respectable witnesses, to\\n whose evidence he solemnly appeals. (116) Prudence would \\n undoubtedly suggest the mild and respectful tone that became\\n a subject and a bishop. In these familiar conferences with\\n the sovereign of the West, Athanasius might lament the error\\n of Constantius, but he boldly arraigned the guilt of his\\n eunuchs and his Arian prelates; deplored the distress and\\n danger of the Catholic church; and excited Constans to\\n emulate the zeal and glory of his father. The emperor\\n declared his resolution of employing the troops and\\n treasures of Europe in the orthodox cause; and signified, by\\n a concise and peremptory epistle to his brother Constantius,\\n that, unless he consented to the immediate restoration of\\n Athanasius, he himself, with a fleet and army, would seat\\n the archbishop on the throne of Alexandria.(117) But this \\n religious war, so horrible to nature, was prevented by the\\n timely compliance of Constantius; and the emperor of the\\n East condescended to solicit a reconciliation with a subject\\n whom he had injured. Athanasius waited with decent pride\\n till he had received three successive epistles full of the\\n strongest assurances of the protection, the favour, and the\\n esteem of his sovereign; who invited him to resume his\\n episcopal seat, and who added the humiliating precaution of\\n engaging his principal ministers to attest the sincerity of\\n his intentions. They were manifested in a still more public\\n manner by the strict orders which were despatched into Egypt\\n to recall the adherents of Athanasius, to restore their\\n privileges, to proclaim their innocence, and to erase from\\n the public registers the illegal proceedings which had been\\n obtained during the prevalence of the Eusebian faction.\\n After every satisfaction and security had been given which\\n justice or even delicacy could require, the primate\\n proceeded, by slow journeys, through the provinces of\\n Thrace, Asia, and Syria; and his progress was marked by the\\n abject homage of the Oriental bishops, who excited his\\n contempt without deceiving his penetration.(118) At Antioch \\n he saw the emperor Constantius; sustained, with modest\\n firmness, the embraces and protestations of his master; and\\n eluded the proposal of allowing the Arians a single church\\n at Alexandria by claiming, in the other cities of the\\n empire, a similar toleration for his own party; a reply\\n which might have appeared just and moderate in the mouth of\\n an independent prince. The entrance of the archbishop into\\n his capital was a triumphal procession; absence and\\n persecution had endeared him to the Alexandrians; his\\n authority, which he exercised with rigour, was more firmly\\n established; and his fame was diffused from Ethiopia to\\n Britain, over the whole extent of the Christian world(119)\\n Resentment of Constantius, A.D. 351 \\n But the subject who has reduced his prince to the necessity\\n of dissembling can never expect a sincere and lasting\\n forgiveness; and the tragic fate of Constans soon deprived\\n Athanasius of a powerful and generous protector. The civil\\n war between the assassin and the only surviving brother of\\n Constans, which afflicted the empire above three years,\\n secured an interval of repose to the Catholic church; and\\n the two contending parties were desirous to conciliate the\\n friendship of a bishop who, by the weight of his personal\\n authority, might determine the fluctuating resolutions of an\\n important province. He gave audience to the ambassadors of\\n the tyrant, with whom he was afterwards accused of holding a\\n secret correspondence; (120) and the emperor Constantius \\n repeatedly assured his dearest father, the most reverend\\n Athanasius, that, notwithstanding the malicious rumours\\n which were circulated by their common enemies, he had\\n inherited the sentiments, as well as the throne, of his\\n deceased brother.(121) Gratitude and humanity would have \\n disposed the primate of Egypt to deplore the untimely fate\\n of Constans, and to abhor the guilt of Magnentius; but as he\\n clearly understood that the apprehensions of Constantius\\n were his only safeguard, the fervour of his prayers for the\\n success of the righteous cause might perhaps be somewhat\\n abated. The ruin of Athanasius was no longer contrived by\\n the obscure malice of a few bigoted or angry bishops, who\\n abused the authority of a credulous monarch. The monarch\\n himself avowed the resolution, which he had so long\\n suppressed, of avenging his private injuries;(122) and the \\n first winter after his victory, which he passed at Arles,\\n was employed against an enemy more odious to him than the\\n vanquished tyrant of Gaul.\\n \\n Councils of Arles and Milan, A.D. 353-355 \\nIf the emperor had capriciously decreed the death of the\\n most eminent and virtuous citizen of the republic, the cruel\\n order would have been executed without hesitation by the\\n ministers of open violence or of specious injustice. The\\n caution, the delay, the difficulty with which he proceeded\\n in the condemnation and punishment of a popular bishop,\\n discovered to the world that the privileges of the church\\n had already revived a sense of order and freedom in the\\n Roman government. The sentence which was pronounced in the\\n synod of Tyre, and subscribed by a large majority of the\\n Eastern bishops, had never been expressly repealed; and as\\n Athanasius had been once degraded from his episcopal dignity\\n by the judgment of his brethren, every subsequent act might\\n be considered as irregular, and even criminal. But the\\n memory of the firm and effectual support which the primate\\n of Egypt had derived from the attachment of the Western\\n church engaged Constantius to suspend the execution of the\\n sentence till he had obtained the concurrence of the Latin\\n bishops. Two years were consumed in ecclesiastical\\n negotiations; and the important cause between the emperor\\n and one of his subjects was solemnly debated, first in the\\n synod of Arles, and afterwards in the great council of\\n Milan,(123) which consisted of above three hundred bishops. \\n Their integrity was gradually undermined by the arguments of\\n the Arians, the dexterity of the eunuchs, and the pressing\\n solicitations of a prince who gratified his revenge at the\\n expense of his dignity, and exposed his own passions whilst\\n he influenced those of the clergy. Corruption, the most\\n infallible symptom of constitutional liberty, was\\n successfully practised; honours, gifts, and immunities were\\n offered and accepted as the price of an episcopal vote;(124) \\n and the condemnation of the Alexandrian primate was artfully\\n represented as the only measure which could restore the\\n peace and union of the Catholic church. The friends of\\n Athanasius were not, however, wanting to their leader, or to\\n their cause. With a manly spirit, which the sanctity of\\n their character rendered less dangerous, they maintained, in\\n public debate, and in private conference with the emperor,\\n the eternal obligation of religion and justice. They\\n declared that neither the hope of his favour, nor the fear\\n of his displeasure, should prevail on them to join in the\\n condemnation of an absent, an innocent, a respectable\\n brother.(125) They affirmed, with apparent reason, that the \\n illegal and obsolete decrees of the council of Tyre had long\\n since been tacitly abolished by the Imperial edicts, the\\n honourable re-establishment of the Archbishop of Alexandria,\\n and the silence or recantation of his most clamorous\\n adversaries. They alleged that his innocence had been\\n attested by the unanimous bishops of Egypt, and had been\\n acknowledged in the councils of Rome and Sardica(126) by the \\n impartial judgment of the Latin church. They deplored the\\n hard condition of Athanasius, who, after enjoying so many\\n years his seat, his reputation, and the seeming confidence\\n of his sovereign, was again called upon to confute the most\\n groundless and extravagant accusations. Their language was\\n specious; their conduct was honourable: but in this long and\\n obstinate contest, which fixed the eyes of the whole empire\\n on a single bishop, the ecclesiastical factions were\\n prepared to sacrifice truth and justice to the more\\n interesting object of defending or removing the intrepid\\n champion of the Nicene faith. The Arians still thought it\\n prudent to disguise, in ambiguous language, their real\\n sentiments and designs; but the orthodox bishops, armed with\\n the favour of the people and the decrees of a general\\n council, insisted on every occasion, and particularly at\\n Milan, that their adversaries should purge themselves from\\n the suspicion of heresy, before they presumed to arraign the\\n conduct of the great Athanasius.(127)\\n Condemnation of Athanasius, A.D. 355. \\n But the voice of reason (if reason was indeed on the side of\\n Athanasius) was silenced by the clamours of a factious or\\n venal majority; and the councils of Arles and Milan were not\\n dissolved till the archbishop of Alexandria had been\\n solemnly condemned and deposed by the judgment of the\\n Western, as well as of the Eastern, church. The bishops who\\n had opposed were required to subscribe the sentence; and to\\n unite in religious communion with the suspected leaders of\\n the adverse party. A formulary of consent was transmitted by\\n the messengers of state to the absent bishops: and all those\\n who refused to submit their private opinion to the public\\n and inspired wisdom of the councils of Arles and Milan were\\n immediately banished by the emperor, who affected to execute\\n the decrees of the catholic church. Among those prelates who\\n led the honourable band of confessors and exiles, Liberius\\n of Rome, Osius of Cordova, Paulinus of Treves, Dionysius of\\n Milan, Eusebius of Vercellae, Lucifer of Cagliari, and\\n Hilary of Poitiers, may deserve to be particularly\\n distinguished. The eminent station of Liberius, who governed\\n the capital of the empire; the personal merit and long\\n experience of the venerable Osius, who was revered as the\\n favourite of the great Constantine, and the father of the\\n Nicene faith, placed those prelates at the head of the Latin\\n church: and their example, either of submission or\\n resistance, would probably be imitated by the episcopal\\n crowds. But the repeated attempts of the emperor to seduce\\n or to intimidate the bishops of Rome and Cordova were for\\n some time ineffectual. The Spaniard declared himself ready\\n to suffer under Constantius, as he had suffered three-score\\n years before under his grandfather Maximian. The Roman, in\\n the presence of his sovereign, asserted the innocence of\\n Athanasius, and his own freedom. When he was banished to\\n Beraea in Thrace, he sent back a large sum which had been\\n offered for the accommodation of his journey; and insulted\\n the court of Milan by the haughty remark, that the emperor\\n and his eunuchs might want that gold to pay their soldiers\\n and their bishops. (128) The resolution of Liberius and Osius \\n was at length subdued by the hardships of exile and\\n confinement. The Roman pontiff purchased his return by some\\n criminal compliances; and afterwards expiated his guilt by a\\n seasonable repentance. Persuasion and violence were employed\\n to extort the reluctant signature of the decrepit bishop of\\n Cordova, whose strength was broken, and whose faculties were\\n perhaps impaired, by the weight of an hundred years; and the\\n insolent triumph of the Arians provoked some of the orthodox\\n party to treat with inhuman severity the character, or\\n rather the memory, of an unfortunate old man, to whose\\n former services Christianity itself was so deeply indebted.\\n (129)\\n Exiles \\nThe fall of Liberius and Osius reflected a brighter lustre\\n on the firmness of those bishops who still adhered, with\\n unshaken fidelity, to the cause of Athanasius and religious\\n truth. The ingenious malice of their enemies had deprived\\n them of the benefit of mutual comfort and advice, separated\\n those illustrious exiles into distant provinces, and\\n carefully selected the most inhospitable spots of a great\\n empire.(130) Yet they soon experienced that the deserts of \\n Libya, and the most barbarous tracts of Cappadocia, were\\n less inhospitable than the residence of those cities in\\n which an Arian bishop could satiate, without restraint, the\\n exquisite rancour of theological hatred. (131) Their \\n consolation was derived from the consciousness of rectitude\\n and independence, from the applause, the visits, the\\n letters, and the liberal alms of their adherents;(132) and \\n from the satisfaction which they soon enjoyed of observing\\n the intestine divisions of the adversaries of the Nicene\\n faith. Such was the nice and capricious taste of the emperor\\n Constantius, and so easily was he offended by the slightest\\n deviation from his imaginary standard of Christian truth,\\n that he persecuted, with equal zeal, those who defended the\\n consubstantiality, those who asserted the similar substance,\\n and those who denied the likeness, of the Son of God. Three\\n bishops, degraded and banished for those adverse opinions,\\n might possibly meet in the same place of exile; and,\\n according to the difference of their temper, might either\\n pity or insult the blind enthusiasm of their antagonists,\\n whose present sufferings would never be compensated by\\n future happiness.\\n \\n Third expulsion of Athanasius from Alexandria, A.D. 356 \\n The disgrace and exile of the orthodox bishops of the West\\n were designed as so many preparatory steps to the ruin of\\n Athanasius himself.(133) Six-and-twenty months had elapsed, \\n during which the Imperial court secretly laboured, by the\\n most insidious arts, to remove him from Alexandria, and to\\n withdraw the allowance which supplied his popular\\n liberality. But when the primate of Egypt, deserted and\\n proscribed by the Latin church, was left destitute of any\\n foreign support, Constantius despatched two of his\\n secretaries with a verbal commission to announce and execute\\n the order of his banishment. As the justice of the sentence\\n was publicly avowed by the whole party, the only motive\\n which could restrain Constantius from giving his messengers\\n the sanction of a written mandate must be imputed to his\\n doubt of the event; and to a sense of the danger to which he\\n might expose the second city and the most fertile province\\n of the empire, if the people should persist in the\\n resolution of defending, by force of arms, the innocence of\\n their spiritual father. Such extreme caution afforded\\n Athanasius a specious pretence respectfully to dispute the\\n truth of an order which he could not reconcile either with\\n the equity or with the former declarations of his gracious\\n master. The civil powers of Egypt found themselves\\n inadequate to the task of persuading or compelling the\\n primate to abdicate his episcopal throne; and they were\\n obliged to conclude a treaty with the popular leaders of\\n Alexandria, by which it was stipulated that all proceedings\\n and all hostilities should be suspended till the emperor\\'s\\n pleasure had been more distinctly ascertained. By this\\n seeming moderation the catholics were deceived into a false\\n and fatal security; while the legions of the Upper Egypt,\\n and of Libya, advanced, by secret orders and hasty marches,\\n to besiege, or rather to surprise, a capital habituated to\\n sedition, and inflamed by religious zeal.(134) The position \\n of Alexandria, between the sea and the lake Mareotis,\\n facilitated the approach and landing of the troops, who were\\n introduced into the heart of the city before any effectual\\n measures could be taken, either to shut the gates, or to\\n occupy the important posts of defence. At the hour of\\n midnight, twenty-three days after the signature of the\\n treaty, Syrianus, duke of Egypt, at the head of five\\n thousand soldiers, armed and prepared for an assault,\\n unexpectedly invested the church of St. Theonas, where the\\n archbishop, with a part of his clergy and people, performed\\n their nocturnal devotions. The doors of the sacred edifice\\n yielded to the impetuosity of the attack, which was\\n accompanied with every horrid circumstance of tumult and\\n bloodshed; but, as the bodies of the slain, and the\\n fragments of military weapons, remained the next day an\\n unexceptionable evidence in the possession of the catholics,\\n the enterprise of Syrianus may be considered as a successful\\n irruption rather than as an absolute conquest. The other\\n churches of the city were profaned by similar outrages; and,\\n during at least four months, Alexandria was exposed to the\\n insults of a licentious army, stimulated by the\\n ecclesiastics of an hostile faction. Many of the faithful\\n were killed, who may deserve the name of martyrs if their\\n deaths were neither provoked nor revenged; bishops and\\n presbyters were treated with cruel ignominy; consecrated\\n virgins were stripped naked, scourged, and violated; the\\n houses of wealthy citizens were plundered; and under the\\n mask of religious zeal, lust, avarice, and private\\n resentment were gratified with impunity, and even with\\n applause. The Pagans of Alexandria, who still formed a\\n numerous and discontented party, were easily persuaded to\\n desert a bishop whom they feared and esteemed. The hopes of\\n some peculiar favours, and the apprehension of being\\n involved in the general penalties of rebellion, engaged them\\n to promise their support to the destined successor of\\n Athanasius, the famous George of Cappadocia. The usurper,\\n after receiving the consecration of an Arian synod, was\\n placed on the episcopal throne by the arms of Sebastian, who\\n had been appointed count of Egypt for the execution of that\\n important design. In the use, as well as in the acquisition,\\n of power, the tyrant George disregarded the laws of\\n religion, of justice, and of humanity; and the same scenes\\n of violence and scandal which had been exhibited in the\\n capital were repeated in more than ninety episcopal cities\\n of Egypt. Encouraged by success, Constantius ventured to\\n approve the conduct of his ministers. By a public and\\n passionate epistle, the emperor congratulates the\\n deliverance of Alexandria from a popular tyrant, who deluded\\n his blind votaries by the magic of his eloquence; expatiates\\n on the virtues and piety of the most reverend George, the\\n elected bishop; and aspires, as the patron and benefactor of\\n the city, to surpass the fame of Alexander himself. But he\\n solemnly declares his unalterable resolution to pursue with\\n fire and sword the seditious adherents of the wicked\\n Athanasius, who, by flying from justice, has confessed his\\n guilt, and escaped the ignominious death which he had so\\n often deserved.(135)\\n His behaviour \\n Athanasius had indeed escaped from the most imminent\\n dangers; and the adventures of that extraordinary man\\n deserve and fix our attention. On the memorable night when\\n the church of St. Theonas was invested by the troops of\\n Syrianus, the archbishop, seated on his throne, expected,\\n with calm and intrepid dignity, the approach of death. While\\n the public devotion was interrupted by shouts of rage and\\n cries of terror, he animated his trembling congregation to\\n express their religious confidence by chanting one of the\\n psalms of David which celebrates the triumph of the God of\\n Israel over the haughty and impious tyrant of Egypt. The\\n doors were at length burst open: a cloud of arrows was\\n discharged among the people; the soldiers, with drawn\\n swords, rushed forwards into the sanctuary; and the dreadful\\n gleam of their armour was reflected by the holy luminaries\\n which burnt round the altar.(136) Athanasius still rejected \\n the pious importunity of the monks and presbyters who were\\n attached to his person; and nobly refused to desert his\\n episcopal station till he had dismissed in safety the last\\n of the congregation. The darkness and tumult of the night\\n favoured the retreat of the archbishop; and though he was\\n oppressed by the waves of an agitated multitude, though he\\n was thrown to the ground, and left without sense or motion,\\n he still recovered his undaunted courage, and eluded the\\n eager search of the soldiers, who were instructed by their\\n Arian guides that the head of Athanasius would be the most\\n acceptable present to the emperor. From that moment the\\n primate of Egypt disappeared from the eyes of his enemies,\\n and remained above six years concealed in impenetrable\\n obscurity.(137)\\n His retreat, A.D. 356-362 \\n The despotic power of his implacable enemy filled the whole\\n extent of the Roman world and the exasperated monarch had\\n endeavoured, by a very pressing epistle to the Christian\\n princes of Ethiopia, to exclude Athanasius from the most\\n remote and sequestered regions of the earth. Counts,\\n praefects, tribunes, whole armies, were successively\\n employed to pursue a bishop and a fugitive; the vigilance of\\n the civil and military powers was excited by the Imperial\\n edicts; liberal rewards were promised to the man who should\\n produce Athanasius, either alive or dead; and the most\\n severe penalties were denounced against those who should\\n dare to protect the public enemy. (138) But the deserts of \\n Thebais were now peopled by a race of wild, yet submissive\\n fanatics, who preferred the commands of their abbot to the\\n laws of their sovereign. The numerous disciples of Antony\\n and Pachomius received the fugitive primate as their father,\\n admired the patience and humility with which he conformed to\\n their strictest institutions, collected every word which\\n dropped from his lips as the genuine effusions of inspired\\n wisdom; and persuaded themselves that their prayers, their\\n fasts, and their vigils, were less meritorious than the zeal\\n which they expressed, and he dangers which they braved, in\\n the defence of truth and innocence.(139) The monasteries of \\n Egypt were seated in lonely and desolate places, on the\\n summit of mountains, or in the islands of the Nile; and the\\n sacred horn or trumpet of Tabenne was the well-known signal\\n which assembled several thousand robust and determined\\n monks, who, for the most part, had been the peasants of the\\n adjacent country. When their dark retreats were invaded by a\\n military force which it was impossible to resist, they\\n silently stretched out their necks to the executioner; and\\n supported their national character, that tortures could\\n never wrest from an Egyptian the confession of a secret\\n which he was resolved not to disclose.(140) The archbishop of \\n Alexandria, for whose safety they eagerly devoted their\\n lives, was lost among a uniform and well-disciplined\\n multitude; and on the nearer approach of danger, he was\\n swiftly removed, by their officious hands, from one place of\\n concealment to another, till he reached the formidable\\n deserts, which the gloomy and credulous temper of\\n superstition had peopled with daemons and savage monsters.\\n The retirement of Athanasius, which ended only with the life\\n of Constantius, was spent, for the most part, in the society\\n of the monks, who faithfully served him as guards, as\\n secretaries, and as messengers; but the importance of\\n maintaining a more intimate connection with the catholic\\n party tempted him, whenever the diligence of the pursuit was\\n abated, to emerge from the desert, to introduce himself into\\n Alexandria, and to trust his person to the discretion of his\\n friends and adherents. His various adventures might have\\n furnished the subject of a very entertaining romance. He was\\n once secreted in a dry cistern, which he had scarcely left\\n before he was betrayed by the treachery of a female slave;\\n (141) and he was once concealed in a still more extraordinary \\n asylum, the house of a virgin, only twenty years of age, and\\n who was celebrated in the whole city for her exquisite\\n beauty. At the hour of midnight, as she related her story\\n many years afterwards, she was surprised by the appearance\\n of the archbishop in a loose undress, who, advancing with\\n hasty steps, conjured her to afford him the protection which\\n he had been directed by a celestial vision to seek under her\\n hospitable roof. The pious maid accepted and preserved the\\n sacred pledge which was intrusted to her prudence and\\n courage. Without imparting the secret to any one, she\\n instantly conducted Athanasius into her most sacred chamber,\\n and watched over his safety with the tenderness of a friend\\n and the assiduity of a servant. As long as the danger\\n continued, she regularly supplied him with books and\\n provisions, washed his feet, managed his correspondence, and\\n dexterously concealed from the eye of suspicion this\\n familiar and solitary intercourse between a saint whose\\n character required the most unblemished chastity, and a\\n female whose charms might excite the most dangerous\\n emotions.(142) During the six years of persecution and exile, \\n Athanasius repeated his visits to his fair and faithful\\n companion; and the formal declaration, that he saw the\\n councils of Rimini and Seleucia, (143) forces us to believe \\n that he was secretly present at the time and place of their\\n convocation. The advantage of personally negotiating with\\n his friends, and of observing and improving the divisions of\\n his enemies, might justify, in a prudent statesman, so bold\\n and dangerous an enterprise: and Alexandria was connected by\\n trade and navigation with every seaport of the\\n Mediterranean. From the depth of his inaccessible retreat\\n the intrepid primate waged an incessant and offensive war\\n against the protector of the Arians; and his seasonable\\n writings, which were diligently circulated and eagerly\\n perused, contributed to unite and animate the orthodox\\n party. In his public apologies, which he addressed to the\\n emperor himself, he sometimes affected the praise of\\n moderation; whilst at the same time, in secret and vehement\\n invectives, he exposed Constantius as a weak and wicked\\n prince, the executioner of his family, the tyrant of the\\n republic, and the Anti-christ of the church. In the height\\n of his prosperity, the victorious monarch, who had chastised\\n the rashness of Gallus, and suppressed the revolt of\\n Sylvanus, who had taken the diadem from the head of\\n Vetranio, and vanquished in the field the legions of\\n Magnentius, received from an invisible hand a wound which he\\n could neither heal nor revenge; and the son of Constantine\\n was the first of the Christian princes who experienced the\\n strength of those principles which, in the cause of\\n religion, could resist the most violent exertions of the\\n civil power.(144)\\n Arian Bishops \\nThe persecution of Athanasius and of so many respectable\\n bishops, who suffered for the truth of their opinions, or at\\n least for the integrity of their conscience, was a just\\n subject of indignation and discontent to all Christians,\\n except those who were blindly devoted to the Arian faction.\\n The people regretted the loss of their faithful pastors,\\n whose banishment was usually followed by the intrustion of a\\n stranger(145) into the episcopal chair, and loudly complained \\n that the right of election was violated, and that they were\\n condemned to obey a mercenary usurper, whose person was\\n unknown and whose principles were suspected. The catholics\\n might prove to the world that they were not involved in the\\n guilt and heresy of their ecclesiastical governor, by\\n publicly testifying their dissent, Divisions or by totally separating\\n themselves from his communion. The first of these methods\\n was invented at Antioch, and practised with such success\\n that it was soon diffused over the Christian world. The\\n doxology, or sacred hymn, which celebrates the glory of the\\n Trinity, is susceptible of very nice, but material,\\n inflections; and the substance of an orthodox or an\\n heretical creed may be expressed by the difference of a\\n disjunctive or a copulative particle. Alternate responses\\n and a more regular paslmody (146) were introduced into the \\n public service by Flavianus and Diodorus, two devout and\\n active laymen, who were attached to the Nicene faith. Under\\n their conduct a swarm of monks issued from the adjacent\\n desert, bands of well-disciplined singers were stationed in\\n the cathedral of Antioch, the Glory to the Father, AND the\\n Son, AND the Holy Ghost (147) was triumphantly chanted by a full chorus of voices, and the catholics insulted, by the\\n purity of their doctrine, the Arian prelate who had usurped\\n the throne of the venerable Eustathius. The same zeal which\\n inspired their songs prompted the more scrupulous members\\n the orthodox party to form separate assemblies which were\\n governed by the presbyters, till the death of their exiled\\n bishop allowed the election and consecration of a new\\n episcopal pastor.(148) The revolutions of the court multiplied the number of pretenders, and the same city was often disputed, under the\\n reign of Constantius, by two, or three, or even four\\n bishops, who exercised their spiritual jurisdiction over\\n their respective followers, and alternately lost and\\n regained temporal possessions of the church. The abuse of\\n Christianity introduced into the Roman government new causes\\n of tyranny and sedition; the bands of civil society were\\n torn asunder by the fury of religious factions; and the\\n obscure citizen, who might calmly have surveyed the\\n elevation and fall of successive emperors, imagined and\\n experienced that his own life and fortune were connected\\n with the interests of a popular ecclesiastic. The example of\\n the two capitals, Rome and Constantinople, may serve to\\n represent the state of the empire and the temper of mankind\\n under the reign of the sons of Constantine.\\n \\n Rome\\nI. The Roman pontiff, as long as he maintained his station\\n and his principles, was guarded by the warm attachment of a\\n great people, and could reject with scorn the prayers, the\\n menaces, and the oblations of an heretical prince. When the\\n eunuchs had secretly pronounced the exile of Liberius, the\\n well-grounded apprehension of a tumult engaged them to use\\n the utmost precautions in the execution of the sentence. The\\n capital was invested on every side, and the praefect was\\n commanded to seize the person of the bishop, either by\\n stratagem or by open force. The order was obeyed, and\\n Liberius, with the greatest difficulty, at the hour of\\n midnight, was swiftly conveyed beyond the reach of the Roman\\n people before their consternation was turned into rage. As\\n soon as they were informed of his banishment into Thrace, a\\n general assembly was convened, and the clergy of Rome bound\\n themselves, by a public and solemn oath, never to desert\\n their bishop, never to acknowledge the usurper Felix, who,\\n by the influence of the eunuchs, had been irregularly chosen\\n and consecrated within the walls of a profane palace. At the\\n end of two years their pious obstinacy subsisted entire and\\n unshaken; and when Constantius visited Rome, he was assailed\\n by the importunate solicitations of a people who had\\n preserved, as the last remnant of their ancient freedom, the\\n right of treating their sovereign with familiar insolence.\\n The wives of many of the senators and most honourable\\n citizens, after pressing their husbands to intercede in\\n favour of Liberius, were advised to undertake a commission\\n which in their hands would be less dangerous and might prove\\n more successful. The emperor received with politeness these\\n female deputies, whose wealth and dignity were displayed in\\n the magnificence of their dress and ornaments; he admired\\n their inflexible resolution of following their beloved\\n pastor to the most distant regions of the earth, and\\n consented that the two bishops, Liberius and Felix, should\\n govern in peace their respective congregations. But the\\n ideas of toleration were so repugnant to the practice, and\\n even to the sentiments, of those times, that, when the answer of Constantius was publicly read in the Circus of Rome, so reasonable a project of accommodation was rejected with contempt and ridicule. The eager vehemence which animated the spectators on the decisive moment of a horserace was now directed towards a different object, and the Circus resounded with the shout of thousands, who repeatedly exclaimed \"One God, One Christ, One Bishop!\"  The zeal of the Roman people in the cause of Liberius was not confined to words alone, and the dangerous and bloody sedition which they excited soon after the departure of Constantius determined that prince to accept the submission of the exiled prelate, and to restore him to the undivided dominion of the capital. After some ineffectual resistance, his rival was expelled from the city by the permission of the emperor and the power of the opposite faction; the adherents of Felix were inhumanly murdered in the streets, in the public places, in the baths, and even in the churches; and the face of Rome, upon the return of a Christian bishop, renewed the horrid image of the massacres of Marius and the proscriptions of Sylla.(149)\\n Constantinople\\nII. Notwithstanding the rapid increase of Christians under\\n the reign of the Flavian family, Rome, Alexandria, and the\\n other great cities of the empire, still contained a strong\\n and powerful faction of Infidels, who envied the prosperity,\\n and who ridiculed, even in their theatres, the theological\\n disputes of the church. Constantinople alone enjoyed the\\n advantage of being born and educated in the bosom of the\\n faith. The capital of the East had never been polluted by\\n the worship of idols, and the whole body of the people had\\n deeply imbibed the opinions, the virtues, and the passions\\n which distinguished the Christians of that age from the rest\\n of mankind. After the death of Alexander the episcopal\\n throne was disputed by Paul and Macedonius. By their zeal\\n and abilities they both deserved the eminent station to\\n which they aspired; and if the moral character of Macedonius\\n was less exceptionable, his competitor had the advantage of\\n a prior election and a more orthodox doctrine. His firm\\n attachment to the Nicene creed, which has given Paul a place\\n in the calendar among saints and martyrs, exposed him to the\\n resentment of the Arians. In the space of fourteen years he\\n was five times driven from his throne, to which he was more\\n frequently restored by the violence of the people than by\\n the permission of the prince, and the power of Macedonius\\n could be secured only by the death of his rival. The\\n unfortunate Paul was dragged in chains from the sandy\\n deserts of Mesopotamia to the most desolate places of Mount\\n Taurus,(150) confined in a dark and narrow dungeon, left six \\n days without food, and at length strangled, by the order of\\n Philip, one of the principal ministers of the emperor\\n Constantius.(151) The first blood which stained the new \\n capital was spilt in this ecclesiastical contest, and many\\n persons were slain on both sides in the furious and\\n obstinate seditions of the people. The commission of\\n enforcing a sentence of banishment against Paul had been\\n intrusted to Hermogenes, the master-general of the cavalry,\\n but the execution of it was fatal to himself. The catholics\\n rose in the defence of their bishop; the palace of\\n Hermogenes was consumed; the first military officer of the\\n empire was dragged by the heels through the streets of\\n Constantinople, and, after he expired, his lifeless corpse\\n was exposed to their wanton insults. (152) The fate of \\n Hermogenes instructed Philip, the Praetorian praefect, to\\n act with more precaution on a similar occasion. In the most\\n gentle and honourable terms he required the attendance of\\n Paul in the baths of Zeuxippus, which had a private\\n communication with the palace and the sea. A vessel, which\\n lay ready at the garden stairs, immediately hoisted sail,\\n and, while the people were still ignorant of the meditated\\n sacrilege, their bishop was already embarked on his voyage\\n to Thessalonica. They soon beheld, with surprise and\\n indignation, the gates of the palace thrown open, and the\\n usurper Macedonius seated by the side of the praefect on a\\n lofty chariot, which was surrounded by troops of guards with\\n drawn swords. The military procession advanced towards the\\n cathedral, and the Arians and the catholics eagerly rushed\\n to occupy that important post, and three thousand one\\n hundred and fifty persons lost their lives in the confusion\\n of the tumult. Macedonius, who was supported by a regular\\n force, obtained a decisive victory, but his reign was\\n disturbed by clamour and sedition, and the causes which\\n appeared the least connected with the subject of dispute\\n were sufficient to nourish and to kindle the flame of civil\\n discord. As the chapel in which the body of the great\\n Constantine had been deposited was in a ruinous condition,\\n the bishop transported those venerable remains into the\\n church of St. Acacius. This prudent and even pious measure\\n was represented as a wicked profanation by the whole party\\n which adhered to the Homoousian doctrine. The factions\\n immediately flew to arms, the consecrated ground was used as\\n their field of battle, and one of the ecclesiastical\\n historians has observed, as a real fact, not as a figure of\\n rhetoric, that the well before the church overflowed with a\\n stream of blood which filled the porticoes and the adjacent\\n courts. The writer who should impute these tumults solely to\\n a religious principle would betray a very imperfect\\n knowledge of human nature; yet it must be confessed that the\\n motive which misled the sincerity of zeal, and the pretence\\n which disguised the licentiousness of passion, suppressed\\n the remorse which, in another cause, would have succeeded to\\n the rage of the Christians of Constantinople.(153)\\n Cruelty of the Arians \\nThe cruel and arbitrary disposition of Constantius, which\\n did not always require the provocations of guilt and\\n resistance, was justly exasperated by the tumults of his\\n capital and the criminal behaviour of a faction which\\n opposed the authority and religion of their sovereign The\\n ordinary punishments of death, exile, and confiscation were\\n inflicted with partial rigour, and the Greeks still revere\\n the holy memory of two clerks, a reader and a subdeacon, who\\n were accused of the murder of Hermogenes, and beheaded at\\n the gates of Constantinople. By an edict of Constantius\\n against the catholics, which has not been judged worthy of a\\n place in the Theodosian code, those who refused to\\n communicate with the Arian bishops, and particularly with\\n Macedonius, were deprived of the immunities of ecclesiastics\\n and of the rights of Christians; they were compelled to\\n relinquish the possession of the churches, and were strictly\\n prohibited from holding their assemblies within the walls of\\n the city. The execution of this unjust law in the provinces\\n of Thrace and Asia Minor was committed to the zeal of\\n Macedonius; the civil and military powers were directed to\\n obey his commands; and the cruelties exercised by this\\n Semi-Arian tyrant in the support of the Homoiousion exceeded\\n the commission and disgraced the reign of Constantius. The\\n sacraments of the church were administered to the reluctant\\n victims, who denied the vocation and abhorred the principles\\n of Macedonius. The rites of baptism were conferred on women\\n and children who, for that purpose, had been torn from the\\n arms of their friends and parents; the mouths of the\\n communicants were held open by a wooden engine while the\\n consecrated bread was forced down their throat; the breasts\\n of tender virgins were either burnt with red-hot eggshells,\\n or inhumanly compressed between sharp and heavy boards.(154) \\n The Novatians of Constantinople and the adjacent country, by\\n their firm attachment to the Homoousian standard, deserved\\n to be confounded with the catholics themselves. Macedonius\\n was informed that a large district of Paphlagonia was almost\\n entirely inhabited by those sectaries. He resolved either to\\n convert or to extirpate them, and, as he distrusted on this\\n occasion the efficacy of an ecclesiastical mission, he\\n commanded a body of four thousand legionaries to march\\n against the rebels, and to reduce the territory of Mantinium\\n (155) under his spiritual dominion. The Novatian peasants, \\n animated by despair and religious fury, boldly encountered\\n the invaders of their country, and, though many of the\\n Paphlagonians were slain, the Roman legions were vanquished\\n by an irregular multitude, armed only with scythes and axes,\\n and, except a few who escaped by an ignominious flight, four\\n thousand soldiers were left dead on the field of battle. The\\n successor of Constantius has expressed, in a concise but\\n lively manner, some of the theological calamities which\\n afflicted the empire, and more especially the East, in the\\n reign of a prince who was the slave of his own passions, and\\n of those of his eunuchs.  The revolt and fury of the Donatists Circumcellions, A.D. 345 etc \\n While the flames of the Arian controversy consumed the vitals of the empire, the African provinces were infested by their peculiar enemies, the savage fanatics, who, under the name of Circumcellions, formed the strength and scandal of the Donatist party. (157) The severe execution of the laws of  Constantine had excited a spirit of discontent and resistance; the strenuous efforts of his son Constans to restore the unity of the church exasperated the sentiments of mutual hatred which had first occasioned the separation; and the methods of force and corruption employed by the two Imperial commissioners, Paul and Macarius, furnished the schismatics with a specious contrast between the maxims of the apostles and the conduct of their pretended successors. (158) The peasants who inhabited the villages of Numidia and Mauritania were a ferocious race, who had been imperfectly reduced under the authority of the Roman laws, who were imperfectly converted to the Christian faith, but who were actuated by a blind and furious enthusiasm in the cause of their Donatist teachers. They indignantly supported the exile of their bishops, the demolition of their churches, and the interruption of their secret assemblies. The violence of the officers of justice, who were usually sustained by a military guard, was sometimes repelled with equal violence, and the blood of some popular ecclesiastics, which had been shed in the quarrel, inflamed their rude followers with an eager desire of revenging the death of these holy martyrs. By their own cruelty and rashness the ministers of persecution sometimes provoked their fate, and the guilt of an accidental tumult precipitated the criminals into despair and rebellion. Driven from their native villages, the Donatist peasants assembled in formidable gangs on the edge of the Gaetulian desert, and readily exchanged the habits of labor for a life of idleness and rapine, which was consecrated by the name of religion, and faintly condemned by the doctors of the sect. The leaders of the Circumcellions assumed the title of captains of the saints; their principal weapon, as they were indifferently provided with swords and spears, was a huge and weighty club, which they termed an \\'Israelite\\', and the well-known sound of \"Praise be to God!\"  which they used as their cry of war, diffused consternation over the unarmed provinces of Africa. At first their depredations were coloured by the plea of necessity, but they soon exceeded the measure of subsistence, indulged without control their intemperance and\\n avarice, burnt the villages which they had pillaged, and reigned the licentious tyrants of the open country. The occupations of husbandry and the administration of justice were interrupted; and, as the Circumcellions pretended to restore the primitive equality of mankind, and to reform the\\n abuses of civil society, they opened a secure asylum for the\\n slaves and debtors who flocked in crowds to their holy\\n standard. When they were not resisted they usually contented\\n themselves with plunder, but the slightest opposition\\n provoked them to acts of violence and murder; and some\\n catholic priests, who had imprudently signalised their zeal,\\n were tortured by the fanatics with the most refined and\\n wanton barbarity. The spirit of the Circumcellions was not\\n always exerted against their defenceless enemies; they\\n engaged, and sometimes defeated, the troops of the province,\\n and in the bloody action of Bagai they attacked in the open\\n field, but with unsuccessful valour, an advanced guard of\\n the Imperial cavalry. The Donatists who were taken in arms\\n received, and they soon deserved, the same treatment which\\n might have been shown to the wild beasts of the desert. The\\n captives died, without a murmur, either by the sword, the\\n axe, or the fire; and the measures of retaliation were\\n multiplied in a rapid proportion, which aggravated the\\n horrors of rebellion and excluded the hope of mutual\\n forgiveness. In the beginning of the present century the\\n example of the Circumcellions has been renewed in the\\n persecution, the boldness, the crimes and the enthusiasm of\\n the Camisards; and if the fanatics of Languedoc surpassed\\n those of Numidia by their military achievements, the\\n Africans maintained their fierce independence with more\\n resolution and perseverance.(159)\\n Their religious suicides \\nSuch disorders are the natural effects of religious tyranny;\\n but the rage of the Donatists was inflamed by a frenzy of a\\n very extraordinary kind; and which, if it really prevailed\\n among them in so extravagant a degree, cannot surely be\\n paralleled in any country or in any age. Many of these fanatics were possessed with the horror of life, and the desire of martyrdom; and they deemed it of\\n little moment by what means, or by what hands, they\\n perished, if their conduct was sanctified by the intention\\n of devoting themselves to the glory of the true faith, and\\n the hope of eternal happiness. (160) Sometimes they rudely \\n disturbed the festivals, and profaned the temples of\\n Paganism, with the design of exciting the most zealous of\\n the idolaters to revenge the insulted honour of their gods.\\n They sometimes forced their way into the courts of justice,\\n and compelled the affrighted judge to give orders for their\\n immediate execution. They frequently stopped travellers on\\n the public highways, and obliged them to inflict the stroke\\n of martyrdom, by the promise of a reward if they consented,\\n and by the threat of instant death if they refused to grant\\n so very singular a favor. When they were disappointed of\\n every other resource, they announced the day on which, in\\n the presence of their friends and brethren, they should cast\\n themselves headlong from some lofty rock; and many\\n precipices were shown which had acquired fame by the number\\n of religious suicides. In the actions of these desperate\\n enthusiasts, who were admired by one party as the martyrs of\\n God, and abhorred by the other as the victims of Satan, an\\n impartial philosopher may discover the influence and the\\n last abuse of that inflexible spirit which was originally\\n derived from the character and principals of the Jewish\\n nation.\\n \\n General character of the Christian sects, A.D. 312-361. \\nThe simple narrative of the intestine divisions which\\n distracted the peace and dishonoured the triumph of the\\n church, will confirm the remark of a Pagan historian, and\\n justify the complaint of a venerable bishop. The experience\\n of Ammianus had convinced him that the enmity of the\\n Christians towards each other surpassed the fury of savage\\n beasts against man; (161) and Gregory Nazianzen most \\n pathetically laments that the kingdom of heaven was\\n converted by discord into the image of chaos, of a nocturnal\\n tempest, and of hell itself. (162) The fierce and partial \\n writers of the times, ascribing all virtue to themselves,\\n and imputing all guilt to their adversaries, have painted\\n the battle of the angels and daemons. Our calmer reason will\\n reject such pure and perfect monsters of vice or sanctity,\\n and will impute an equal, or at least an indiscriminate,\\n measure of good and evil to the hostile sectaries, who\\n assumed and bestowed the appellations of orthodox and\\n heretics. They had been educated in the same religion and\\n the same civil society. Their hopes and fears in the\\n present, or in a future life, were balanced in the same\\n proportion. On either side the error might be innocent, the\\n faith sincere, the practice meritorious or corrupt. Their\\n passions were excited by similar objects; and they might\\n alternately abuse the favour of the court, or of the people.\\n The metaphysical opinions of the Athanasians and the Arians\\n could not influence their moral character; and they were\\n alike actuated by the intolerant spirit which has been\\n extracted from the pure and simple maxims of the Gospel.\\n \\n Toleration of paganism \\nA modern writer, who, with a just confidence, has prefixed\\n to his own history the honourable epithets of political and\\n philosophical, (163) accuses the timid prudence of \\n Montesquieu, for neglecting to enumerate, among the causes\\n of the decline of the empire, a law of Constantine, by which\\n the exercise of the Pagan worship was absolutely suppressed,\\n and a considerable part of his subjects was left destitute\\n of priests, temples, and of any public religion. The zeal of\\n the philosophic historian for the rights of mankind has\\n induced him to acquiesce in the ambiguous testimony of those\\n ecclesiastics who have too lightly ascribed to their\\n favourite hero the merit of a general persecution.(164) \\n Instead of alleging this imaginary law, which would have\\n blazed in the front of the Imperial codes, we may safely\\n appeal to the original epistle which Constantine addressed\\n to the followers of the ancient religion, at a time when he\\n no long disguised his conversion, nor dreaded the rivals of\\n his throne. He invites and exhorts, in the most pressing\\n terms, the subjects of the Roman empire to imitate the\\n exampleby Constantine, of their master; but he declares that those who still refuse to open their eyes to the celestial light may free enjoy their temples and their fancied gods. A report\\n that the ceremonies of Paganism were suppressed is formally\\n contradicted by the emperor himself, who wisely assigns, as\\n the principle of his moderation, the invincible force of\\n habit, of prejudice, and of superstition. (165) Without \\n violating the sanctity of his promise, without alarming the\\n fears of the Pagans, the artful monarch advanced, by slow\\n and cautious steps, to undermine the irregular and decayed\\n fabric of polytheism. The partial acts of severity which he\\n occasionally exercised, though they were secretly prompted\\n by a Christian zeal, were coloured by the fairest pretences\\n of justice and the public good; and while Constantine\\n designed to ruin the foundations, he seemed to reform the\\n abuses, of the ancient religion. After the example of the\\n wisest of his predecessors, he condemned, under the most\\n rigorous penalties, the occult and impious arts of\\n divination, which excited the vain hopes, and sometimes the\\n criminal attempts, of those who were discontented with their\\n present condition. An ignominious silence was imposed on the\\n oracles, which had been publicly convicted of fraud and\\n falsehood; the effeminate priests of the Nile were\\n abolished; and Constantine discharged the duties of a Roman\\n censor, when he gave orders for the demolition of several\\n temples of Phoenicia, in which every mode of prostitution\\n was devoutly practised in the face of day, and to the honour\\n of Venus.(166) The Imperial city of Constantinople was, in \\n some measure, raised at the expense, and was adorned with\\n the spoils, of the opulent temples of Greece and Asia; the\\n sacred property; was confiscated; the statues of gods and\\n heroes were transported, with rude familiarity, among a\\n people who considered them as objects, not of adoration, but\\n of curiosity; the gold and silver were restored to\\n circulation; and the magistrates, the bishops, and the\\n eunuchs, improved the fortunate occasion of gratifying, at\\n once, their zeal, their avarice, and their resentment. But\\n these depredations were confined to a small part of the\\n Roman world; and the provinces had been long since\\n accustomed to endure the same sacrilegious rapine, from the\\n tyranny of princes and proconsuls who could not be suspected\\n of any design to subvert the established religion.(167)\\n and his sons. \\n The sons of Constantine trod in the footsteps of their\\n father with more zeal and with less discretion. The\\n pretences of rapine and oppression were insensibly multiplied (168); every indulgence was shown to the illegal behaviour of the Christians; every doubt was explained to the disadvantage of Paganism, and the demolition of the temples was celebrated as one of the auspicious events of the reign of Constans and Constantius. (169) The name of Constantius is prefixed to a concise law, which might have superseded the necessity of any future prohibitions.   But there is the  strongest reason to believe that this formidable edict was either composed without being published, or was published without being executed. The evidence of facts, and the monuments which are still extant of brass and marble, continue to prove the public exercise of the Pagan worship during the whole reign of the sons of Constantine. In the East as well as in the West, in cities as well as in the country, a great number of temples were respected, or at least were spared; and the devout multitude still enjoyed the luxury of sacrifices, of festivals, and of processions, by the permission, or by the connivance, of the civil government. About four years after the supposed date of his bloody edict, Constantius visited the temples of Rome; and the decency of his behaviour is recommended by a Pagan orator as an example worthy of the imitation of succeeding princes.  The senate still presumed to consecrate, by solemn decrees, the divine\\n memory of their sovereigns; and Constantine himself was associated, after death, to those gods whom he had renounced and insulted during his life. The title, the ensigns, the prerogatives, of SOVEREIGN PONTIFF, which had been instituted by Numa, and assumed by Augustus, were accepted, without hesitation, by seven Christian emperors, who were invested with a more absolute authority over the religion which they had deserted than over that which they professed. (172)\\n  The divisions of Christianity suspended the ruin of Paganism; (173) and the holy war against the infidels was less vigorously prosecuted by princes and bishops who were more immediately alarmed by the guilt and danger of domestic rebellion. The extirpation of idolatry (174) might have been justified by the established principles of intolerance: but the hostile sects, which alternately reigned in the Imperial court, were mutually apprehensive of alienating, and perhaps exasperating, the minds of a powerful, though declining faction. Every motive of authority and fashion, of interest and reason, now militated on the side of Christianity; but two or three generations elapsed before their victorious influence was universally felt. The religion which had so long and so lately been established in the Roman empire was still revered by a numerous people, less attached indeed to speculative opinion than to ancient custom. The honours of the state and army were indifferently bestowed on all the subjects of Constantine and Constantius; and a considerable portion of knowledge and wealth and valour was still engaged in the service of polytheism. The superstition of the senator and of the peasant, of the poet and the philosopher, was derived from very different causes, but they met with equal devotion in the temples of the gods. Their zeal was insensibly provoked by the insulting triumph of a proscribed sect; and their hopes we revived by the well-grounded confidence that the presumptive heir of the empire, a young and valiant hero, who had delivered Gaul from the arms of the barbarians, had secretly embraced the religion of his ancestors.'"

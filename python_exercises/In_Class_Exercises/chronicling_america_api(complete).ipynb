CONVENTION.\\nThe following Address and Resolutions\\nwere lead before the Faneuil Hull Convention by\\nR. H. Dana, Esq :\\n1 > the Senators and Representatives of M.usachascUs in\\nthe Congress of the United States\\nAs Citizens of Massachusetts, assembled in Faneuil\\nHall, representing thousands in all parts of the Com\\nmouwealth, we take it upon ourselves to address you\\nupon the great question about to be decided by Con\\ngress and by your votes. The magnitude of the\\nquestion, the precedents of three generations, the\\ngenius ot republican institutions, all assure us of our\\nright to address you, from this place and in this man\\nner, and warrant us in looking for a respectful con\\nsideration at your hands.\\nBut before we utter a word on the great subject of\\nthe present issue, justice to our cause requires that\\nwe relieve ourselves from certain imputations indus\\ntriously circulated against us. As defenders of the\\nI‘ ree Soil doctrine, we are slanderously reported\\nto be disumonists, agitators, fanatics; and it is one\\nof the tricks of the times in politics to set oft’the Free\\nSoil party of the North, as eqivalent to the pro-sla\\nvery disuniouists of the South. If this were so, we\\nshould not deserve attention from meh sworn to sup\\nport the Constitution. But so far is it from being\\ntrue, that we assert now, in the most solemn man\\nlier, our determined allegiance to the Constitution\\nof the United States. We assure you, and beg you\\nto assure our brethren in Congress, Southern as well\\nas Northern, that whether victorious or defeated in\\nthis issue, we mean to sustain the Union and the con\\nstitution thereof. Wa ask you to assure the Chief\\nMagistrate of the Union, and all the heads of depart\\nments, that to no citizens of the Republic more than\\nto the Free Soil men of Massachusetts, can they look\\nfor faithful support in all proper and legal measures\\nfor maintaining the integrity of the United States.\\nIt is under the Constitution, and within the Union,\\nthat we mean to contend to the last against the ex\\ntension of Slavery. Nor do we dream, nor have we\\never dreamed ot interfering with Slavery in the States.\\nWc understand as perfectly as Mr. Calhoun himself,\\nthat Congress has no more right to interfere with the\\ndomestic institutions of South Carolina, than to inter\\nfere with the domestic institutions of Massachusetts.\\nWe are simply the defenders, in this crisis, of the\\ntime-honored,historical, constitutional principle hand\\ned down from our fathers—-the principle of the pro\\nhibition ofSlavery in the territories, as the only means\\nof securing the end of “No new slave States, no new\\nslave territories.”\\nBear with us a moment, while we recapitulate the\\nhistory of this maxim, to draw from it lessons and\\nwarnings for the exigency of the present hour.\\nWe have been told by our fathers, it is cur fami\\nliar learning in Massachusetts, no one of your number\\ndoubts, that when the confederation and constitution\\nwere formed, when the great concessions were made\\nto the slave States, it was upon the understanding\\nthat there were to be no new slave States, no new\\nslave territory. Io ensure this result, the ordinance\\not 1787 was passed prohibiting slavery forever in all\\nthe territories of the United States. T hese territories\\nall lay north of the Ohio river; all in the latitude of\\nthe free States. Why was a prohibition necessary I\\nOur aucesters knew that thecupidity of slave dealers,\\nthe force of habit and prejudice with southern men,\\nthe desire to. increase the slave market, and to add\\nto the weight of the slave States in the Union, would\\nsubject the territories to at least the chance ofbeiii\"\\noverrun with slavery.\\nTimothy Pickering, writing to Rufus King, on the\\nBth of March 1785, speaking of the failure to carry\\nthe prohibition when first attempted, in 1784, says,\\n“Congress once made this important declaration—\\n-1 hat all men are equal? that they are endowed, by\\ntheir creator, with certain inalienable rights; that\\namong these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of hap\\npiness; and these truths were held tobj self-evident.’\\nT hese great truths were echoed through the United\\nStates. Nevertheless, a proposition for preventing a\\nviolation of these truths, in a country yet unsettled,\\nand from which such violence might easily have\\nbeen excluded, did not obtain ! What pretence (ar\\ngument there could be none) could bo ottered for its\\nrejection ? 1 should, indeed, have objected to the\\nperiod proposed (the years 1800) for the exclusion\\nofslavery; for the admission of It for a day or an\\nhour ought to have been forbidder. It will be infin\\nitely easier to prevent the evil at frat, than to eradi\\ncate or check it in any future time. How would’\\nCongress wish the New States to be settled? byslaves\\nor by freemen ? To suffer the continuance of slaves\\ntill they can gradually be emancipated, in States al\\nready overrun with them, may be pardonable, because\\nunavoidable, without hazarding great evils: but to in\\ntroduce them into countries were none now exist\\ncountries which have been talked of—which we have\\nboasted of, as asylums to the oppressed of the earth\\n—can never be forgiven.— For God’s sake then let\\none more effbit be made to prevent so terrible a cal\\namity.”\\nCharles Thompson, the distinguished Secretary of\\nCongress, in a letter to Judge Peters,about the same\\ntune, says, “now, it seems, the measures necessary\\nto be taken io render useful the cessions and purchases\\nare to be obstructed by the men of the South,because\\nthose of the east and north wish to keep Slavery out\\nof the New States. . . . Sure it would be unpardon\\nable in Congress, in erecting New States, not to\\nguard against the introduction ofSlavery, which has\\na direct tendency to the corruption of manners and\\nof every principle of morality and] piety.”\\nThus we see that even in the last century the\\nprinciple of prohibition began to meet with opposition\\nIrom the South, and it was insisted upon by the whole\\nNortli, with the aid of the greatest and best men of\\nthe ..outh, as the only sure mode of preventing the\\nextension of slavery. Here were the germs of the\\ngreat slave-extension party which now embraces al\\nmost the entire South.\\nHistory has shown that the precautions taken bv\\nour ancesters were not vain. In spite of the prohi\\nbition, repeated attempts were made to introduce\\n‘r* s-f Yi\\'l\" 10 aaJ was petitioned to\\ni> the r ord, \" a ™ e > n .\" d « of no less a\\nMr 11 ’\"1 f . ,e . nera, ] Hu IrrH™. 1 rrH ™. and but for the aid which\\nMr. Randolph and other Southern men gave to Hie\\nNorth, the attempt might have succeeded.

Occupation first, ami\\nrecognition afterwards, Lthe hkto y of\\nslavery the world over. 1\\nNothing but prohibition satisfied our ancestors f, lr\\nanother reason.

It would be a fraud and a mockery i„ | ()llV o\\nhe question to be settled by the people 0 / t h“\\ntones, and then refuse them admission into the Union,\\nif they did not settle it in our favor.\\nWe cannot depict the value of this ordinance in\\n: colors half so strong as those in which they have been\\nI painted by an illustrious Senator of your number.\\nI hat instrument was drawn by Nathan Dane, than\\nns now, a citizen of Massachusetts. It fixed forever\\nthe character, of the population in the vast regions\\nnorth west of the Ohio, ,by excluding from them in\\nvoluntary servitude. It impressed on the soil itself,\\nwhile it was yet a wilderness, an incapacity to bear\\nup any other than freemen. It laid the interdict\\nagainst personal servitude, in original compact, not\\ni \\'‘ oC P er *han all local law, but deeper, also, than\\nall local constitutions.”\\ntor thirty years the doctrine of prohibition was\\nshe established, recognized law of the Republic. In\\n1820, with a second generation, the subject came up\\na second time, on the occasion of the admission of\\nMissouri. Again the North asserted the right and\\nduty of prohibition. lii nearly every northern\\n> tate, resolutions passed the Legislatures in its fa\\nvor. Ihe address and resolutions cf our own State,\\nreported by that high minded and just man, Leverett\\n». altonstall, contain the essence of the Free Soil\\nprinciples ofihe present day. In the most decided man\\nner they repudiate a compromise, and insist on the\\nduty of positive prohibition. Wc earnestly com\\nmend them to any of your number who may be hesi-\\nJatmg m his adhesion to the same doctrine now.\\nrhe report says—“ After all the consideration your\\ncommittee have been able to bestow on this momen\\ntous subject, they cannot but express the ardent\\nhope that Congress will interpose to prevent the\\nfurther extension of slavery into Missouri, because\\nit is within their constitutional power, and because\\nit is demanded by humanity’, sound policy, and the\\nprosperity and happiness Oft he Slates to be erected,\\nas well as the common welfare of the United States.”\\n“If, as your committee think, the constitutional right\\nof Gongri ss to interpose, is contained in the\\nand lias been practically settled, it might have been ex\\npected that on the expediency of the proposed restric\\ntion there could have been but one opinion in the Unit\\ned States. * * * * ♦\\nI he restriction is demanded by the honor of our coim\\n‘D’; . * * As connected with the\\nrights of humanity, this question swells into one of im\\nmense magnitude.

It niay justly be expected that Mas\\nsachusetts, which was among the first to extend the\\nblessings of liberty and equal rights to all her inhabit\\nants, would now lift her voice, and use ail her influence\\nto prevent the extension and perpetuity of slavery. Nor\\nda your committee find any reason fur our silence in the cx\\ntraxjrdinaiy manner in which the question has been brought\\nbefore. Congress, by connecting it with the act for the admis\\nsion of Maine into the Union, when no reason whatever is\\nknown to exist against thut measure. 9\\nThe chief resolution was : “Resolced, That it is\\nthe duty of Congress to exercise this power [prohibi\\ntion of slavery] on the admission of all new States\\ninto the Union, beyond the limits of the original tor\\nntory.”\\nMeetings were held in the chief towns of the North,\\nand almost everywhere in Massachusetts to repudi\\nate any compromise. At Boston on December 3d,\\n1819, a nieetmg was held in the State House, with\\nout distinction of party, and embracing the leaders\\nof both sides. That meeting, in its objects,was pre\\ncisely like that now assembled. A large committee\\nwas appointed to prepare resolutions. Of this com\\nmittee, William Eustis, afterwards Governor of Mas\\nsachusetts, was chairman. With him were associa\\nted John Phillips, at that time President of the Sen\\nate of Massachusetts, Timothy Bigelow, Speaker of\\nthe House of Representative, Wiiliain’Uray, Henry-\\nDearborn, Josiah Quincy, Daniel Webster, William\\nWard of Medford,William Prescott, Thomas H. Per\\nkins, Stephen White, Benjamin Pickman, William\\nSullivan, George Blake, David Cummings, Janies\\nSavage, John Gallison, James T. Austin, and Henry\\nOrne. A committee 11101$ calculated to inspire the\\nconfidence of all sides could not have been appointed.\\nNumerous as were its members, they were all meii\\nof mark, high in the confidence and affections of their\\n\\' country. This committee reported the following re\\nsolutions which were adopted by the meeting : °\\n“Resolved, As the opinion of this meeting,\\'that the\\nCongress of the United States possess the constitutional\\npower, upon the admission of any new State created be\\nyond the limits of the original territory of the United\\nEstates, to make the prohibition of the further extension\\not slavery, or involuntary servitude, in such new State,\\na condition of its admission.\\n“ Resolved, That in the opinion of this meeting it is\\njust and expedient that this power should be exercised\\nby Congress upon the admission of all new States, creat\\ned beyond the original limits of the United Suites.”\\nThe meeting in Boston was followed by one in\\nSalem, which was called, according to the terms of\\nthe notice, “ to consider whether the immense region\\nof country extending from the Mississippi to the Pa\\ncific Ocean is destined to betlie abode of Happiness\\nIndependence and Freedom, or the wide prison of\\nmisery and slavery. Resolutions against the ad\\nmission of any slave state, were passed here, being\\nsupported by Benjamin T. Pickman, Andrew Dun\\nlap and Judge Story. In the meeting at Worcester\\nSolomon Strong and Levi Lincoln acted a prominent\\npart. Resolutions were passed here “ earnestly re\\nquesting their representatives in Congress to oppose\\nthe admission of any new slave State.”\\nIn an article written by the present respected Chief\\nJustice of our Statg, in the North American Review\\nthe same ground was taken, and the danger of set\\ntling the question in any other wav than by Prohibi\\ntion, presented, with all the force of truth and earn\\nestness. “ When we think,” says he, “of these\\nmomentous consequences, we feet a solemnity of\\nmind, before which all party questions, all the sophis\\ntry which lively talents can exert in any cause, sink\\nmto the dust; and if it be not too late, we would\\neven now most earnestly implore Heaven to send that\\nsame solemnity into the minds of all, whose voices\\nare to settle this mighty question, it is with the\\nmost unaffected earnestness that we declare our\\nopinion, that the day on which the Missouri question\\nis decided in Congress, will |, e the most eventful dnv\\nin our history.” \\'\\n. With such feelings nt the North, with a majority\\nm Congress, with the whole civilized world on her\\nside, with precedent, usage, justice, policy, all in\\nher favor, why was the North defeated ? Well may\\nit be a matter of wonder and mortification 1 The\\nstory is too dear a lesson and warning for us in the\\npresent crisis to be passed over. The South then, as\\nnow, threatened dissolution. Then, as now, stniid-\\n! n g in unbroken phalanx, she threatened proscription\\nin National politics, to all those who insisted on the\\ninterdiction of slavery. Then, ns now, she seized\\nupon an accidental advantage, und refused to admit\\nMaine into the Union, ns she now does California,\\nexcept on terms of compromise. She terrified the\\ntmnd she addressid the interested and ambitious,\\nthe indiflerent and pusillanimous yielded of course,\\nand the cause of freedom was defeated.\\nIn consequence of thia cojnpromße, camo five\\nS ave States mto the Union. By this compromise,\\nthe precedent of prohibition was broken in upon. Bv\\nthis compromise, a precedent of submission by the\\nNort hiwas estabhshed. From that day the taunt of\\nJohn Randolph became true—“ The South governs\\ntue North; s.ie governs her by her white slaves”\\nBut another and not the worse consequence cf this\\ncompromise was that it established a sectional and\\ngeographical division in the policy of the country.\\nAnd be it known unto all men, that if the evil of a\\ngeographical division in politics has come upon the\\n‘he si\" lies not at the door of the friends of\\n- ree Soil. If the North had stood linn then, if the\\ndoctrine of prohibition had been enforced, there\\nwould have, been free States at the South-west, as\\nwell as at the North-east, and we should have heard\\nno more of south and North, on the slave question.\\nAow, as then, >1 our principle is carried out, and sla\\nvery is prohibited in all the Mexican acquisitions\\nmore will be done than by any other course, to break\\nuj> the umfonmty of the geogi aghica) division.\\nBut we cannot forget that this triumph of slavery\\nlAOuld not have been obtained but for the aid of\\nNorthern votes, New England votes,—it is with deen\\nmort.ficat.on we must add-of two MassachuS\\nvotes, one of which was from Boston. When we\\ncontemplate the fatal effects of this defeat upon the\\ncountry, upon the cause of liberty; when we see its\\ndark outline on the page of history, it is little conso\\nlation to know that the men who so betrayed their\\ntrust, were made to feel the naii ful mu ■ ’\\na withdrawal of public confidence, and\\nalty of political death. And now, as then, if it shall\\nbe the misfortune of Massachusetts to furnish the one\\nor the two votes necessary for the defeat of our cher-\\nXilH Pr n,7 P e ’ . a . sm ‘. ,lar , act of J u s‘ condemnation\\n\\\\ 11 be httle saßslaction for a principle abandoned,\\nand the freedom of vast territories periled, if not lost.\\nAfter a lapse of another period of thirty years a\\nihird generation is called upon to meet this issue.\\nShad he ancient doctrine of Prohibition be enforced,\\nor shall n be abandoned ?\\nIt is not for us to argue with you for its constitu\\n.’ty- . .
